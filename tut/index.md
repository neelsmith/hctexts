## Quick demos

Although scripts like the one in `scripts/analyzeCorpus.sc` have short cuts to some of these things, it's easy enough to look under the hood and see how to use the contents of this project in Scala directly.  The demo pages here are generated using the [`tut` tutorial generator](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut), so all code snippets have actually been run and verified before they are included in these demo web pages.
