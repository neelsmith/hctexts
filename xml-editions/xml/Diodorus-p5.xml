                  <p> The preceding Book, which is the tenth of our narrative, closed with the
                     events of the year just before the crossing of Xerxes into Europe and the
                     formal deliberations which the general assembly of the Greeks held in Corinth
                     on the alliance between Gelon and the Greeks; and in this Book we shall supply
                     the further course of the history, beginning with the campaign of Xerxes
                     against the Greeks, and we shall stop with the year which precedes the campaign
                     of the Athenians against Cyprus under the leadership of Cimon. </p>

                  <p>Calliades was archon in Athens, and the Romans made Spurius Cassius and
                     Proculus Verginius Tricostus consuls, and the Eleians celebrated the
                     Seventy-fifth Olympiad, that in which Astylus of Syracuse won the "stadion." It
                     was in this year that king Xerxes made his campaign against Greece, for the
                     following reason.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p> Mardonius the Persian was a cousin of Xerxes and related to him by marriage,
                     and he was also greatly admired by the Persians because of his sagacity and
                     courage. This man, being elated by pride and at the height of his physical
                     vigour, was eager to be the leader of great armaments; consequently he
                     persuaded Xerxes to enslave the Greeks, who had ever been enemies of the
                     Persians. </p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p> And Xerxes, being won over by him and desiring to drive all the Greeks from
                     their homes, sent an embassy to the Carthaginians to urge them to join him in
                     the undertaking and closed an agreement with them, to the effect that he would
                     wage war upon the Greeks who lived in Greece, while the Carthaginians should at
                     the same time gather great armaments and subdue those Greeks who lived in
                     Sicily and Italy. </p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="5">
                  <p> In accordance, then, with their agreements, the Carthaginians, collecting a
                     great amount of money, gathered mercenaries from both Italy and Liguria and
                     also from Galatia and Iberia; and in addition to these troops they enrolled men
                     of their own race from the whole of Libya and of Carthage; and in the end,
                     after spending three years in constant preparation, they assembled more than
                     three hundred thousand foot-soldiers and two hundred war vessels. </p>

                  <p> Xerxes, vying with the zeal displayed by the Carthaginians, surpassed them in
                     all his preparations to the degree that he excelled the Carthaginians in the
                     multitude of peoples at his command. And he began to have ships built
                     throughout all the territory along the sea that was subject to him, both Egypt
                     and Phoenicia and Cyprus, Cilicia and Pamphylia and Pisidia, and also Lycia,
                     Caria, Mysia, the Troad, and the cities on the Hellespont, and Bithynia, and
                     Pontus. Spending a period of three years, as did the Carthaginians, on his
                     preparations, he made ready more than twelve hundred warships. </p>

                  <p> He was aided in this by his father Darius, who before his death had made
                     preparations of great armaments; for Darius, after Datis, his general, had been
                     defeated by the Athenians at Marathon, had continued to be angry with the
                     Athenians for having won that battle. But Darius, when already about to cross
                     over against the Greeks, was stopped in his plans by death, whereupon Xerxes,
                     induced both by the design of his father and by the counsel of Mardonius, as we
                     have stated, made up his mind to wage war upon the Greeks. </p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p>Now when all preparations for the campaign had been completed, Xerxes commanded
                     his admirals to assemble the ships at Cymê and Phocaea, and he himself
                     collected the foot and cavalry forces from all the satrapies and advanced from
                     Susa. And when he had arrived at Sardis, he dispatched heralds to Greece,
                     commanding them to go to all the states and to demand of the Greeks water and
                     earth. </p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p> Then, dividing his army, he sent in advance a sufficient number of men both to
                     bridge the Hellespont and to dig a canal through Athos at the neck of the
                     Cherronesus, in this way not only making the passage safe and short for his
                     forces but also hoping by the magnitude of his exploits to strike the Greeks
                     with terror before his arrival. Now the men who had been sent to make ready
                     these works completed them with dispatch, because so many labourers co‑operated
                     in the task. </p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="5">
                  <p> And the Greeks, when they learned of the great size of the Persian armaments,
                     dispatched ten thousand hoplites into Thessaly to size the passes of Tempê;
                     Synetus commanded the Lacedaemonians and Themistocles the Athenians. These
                     commanders dispatched ambassadors to the states and asked them to send soldiers
                     to join in the common defence of the passes; for they eagerly desired that all
                     the Greek states should each have a share in the defence and make common cause
                     in the war against the Persians. </p>

               <div
                  n="6">
                  <p> But since the large number of the Thessalians and other Greeks who dwelt near
                     the passes had given the water and earth to the envoys of Xerxes when they
                     arrived, the two generals despaired of the defence at Tempê and returned to
                     their own soil. </p>

                  <p> And now it will be useful to distinguish those Greeks who chose the side of
                     the barbarians, in order that, incurring our censure here, their example may,
                     by the obloquy visited upon them, deter for the future any who may become
                     traitors to the common freedom. </p>

                  <p> The Aenianians, Dolopians, Melians, Perrhaebians, and Magnetans took the side
                     of the barbarians even while the defending force was still at Tempê, and after
                     its departure the Achaeans of Phthia, Locrians, Thessalians, and the majority
                     of the Boeotians went over to the barbarians. </p>

                  <p> But the Greeks who were meeting in congress at the Isthmus voted to make the
                     Greeks who voluntarily chose the cause of the Persians pay a tithe to the gods,
                     when they should be successful in the war, and to send ambassadors to those
                     Greeks who were neutral to urge them to join in the struggle for the common
                     freedom. </p>

                  <p> Of the latter, some joined the alliance without reservation, while others
                     postponed any decision for a considerable time, clinging to their own safety
                     alone and anxiously waiting for the outcome of the war; the Argives, however,
                     sending ambassadors to the common congress, promised to join the alliance if
                     the congress would give them a share in the command. </p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="5">
                  <p> To them the representatives declared plainly that, if they thought it a more
                     terrible thing to have a Greek as general than a barbarian as master, they
                     would do well to remain neutral, but if they were ambitious to secure the
                     leadership of the Greeks, they should, it was stated, first have accomplished
                     deeds deserving of this leadership and then strive for such an honour. After
                     these events, when the ambassadors sent by Xerxes came to Greece and demanded
                     both earth and water, all the states manifested in their replies the zeal they
                     felt for the command freedom. </p>

                  <p>When Xerxes learned that the Hellespont had been bridged and the canal had been
                     dug through Athos, he left Sardis and made his way toward the Hellespont; and
                     when he had arrived at Abydus, he led his army over the bridge into Europe. And
                     as he advanced through Thrace, he added to his forces many soldiers from both
                     the Thracians and neighbouring Greeks. </p>

                  <p> When he arrived at the city called Doriscus, he ordered his fleet to come
                     there, and so both arms of his forces were gathered into one place. And he held
                     there also the enumeration of the entire army, and the number of his land
                     forces was over eight hundred thousand men, while the sum total of his ships of
                     war excelled twelve hundred, of which three hundred and twenty were Greek, the
                     Greeks providing the complement of men and the king supplying the vessels. All
                     the remaining ships were listed as barbarian; and of these the Egyptians
                     supplied two hundred, the Phoenicians three hundred, the Cilicians eighty, the

                     the shores of the Pontus, eighty, and the inhabitants of the islands fifty; for
                     the king had won over to his side the islands lying within the Cyanean Rocks

                     Artemisium in Euboea, recognizing that this place was well suited for meeting
                     the enemy, and a considerable body of hoplites to Thermopylae to forestall them
                     in occupying the passes at the narrowest part of the defile and to prevent the
                     barbarians from advancing against Greece; for they were eager to throw their

                     "Ostensibly I am leading them to the defence of the passes, but in fact to die
                     for the freedom of all; and so, if a thousand set forth, Sparta will be the
                     more renowned when they have died, but if the whole body of the Lacedaemonians
                     take the field, Lacedaemon will be utterly destroyed, for not a man of them, in

                     given earth and water to the Persians, and had promised that they would seize
                     the passes in advance; but when they learned that Leonidas had arrived at
                     Thermopylae, they changed their minds and went over to the Greeks. </p>

                  <p> And there gathered at Thermopylae also a thousand Locrians, an equal number of
                     Melians, and almost a thousand Phocians, as well as some four hundred Thebans
                     of the other party; for the inhabitants of Thebes were divided against each
                     other with respect to the alliance with the Persians. Now the Greeks who were
                     drawn up with Leonidas for battle, being as many in number as we have set
                     forth, tarried in Thermopylae, awaiting the arrival of the Persians. </p>

                     armament there, he summoned his allies from Europe, a little less than two
                     hundred thousand men; so that he now possessed in all not less than one million

                     have mentioned, so that the account usually given of the multitude of the men
                     gathered together by Xerxes need cause no amazement; for men say that the

                     that the seas were hidden by the sails of the ships. However this may be, the

                  <p>After the Persians had encamped on the Spercheius River, Xerxes dispatched
                     envoys to Thermopylae to discover, among other things, how the Greeks felt
                     about the war with him; and he commanded them to make this proclamation: "King
                     Xerxes orders all to give up their arms, to depart unharmed to their native
                     lands, and to be allies of the Persian; and to all Greeks who do this he will
                     give more and better lands than they now possess." </p>

                  <p> But when Leonidas heard the commands of the envoys, he replied to them: "If we
                     should be allies of the king we should be more useful if we kept our arms, and
                     if we should have to wage war against him, we should fight the better for our
                     freedom if we kept them; and as for the lands which he promises to give, the
                     Greeks have learned from their fathers to gain lands, not by cowardice, but by
                     valour." </p>

                     Demaratus, a Spartan who had been exiled from his native land and taken refuge
                     with him, and with a scoff at the replies he asked the Laconian, "Will the
                     Greeks flee more swiftly than my horses can run, or will they dare to face such

                     the courage of the Greeks, since you use Greek forces to quell such barbarians
                     as revolt. So do not think that those who fight better than the Persians to
                     maintain your sovereignty, will risk their lives less bravely against the
                     Persians to maintain their own freedom." But Xerxes with a scoff at him ordered
                     Demaratus to stay by his side in order that he might witness the Lacedaemonians

                  <p>Xerxes with his army came against the Greeks at Thermopylae. And he put the

                     reason of their courage or because he wished to destroy them in a body; for the
                     Medes still retained a proud spirit, the supremacy which their ancestors had
                     exercised having only recently been overthrown. </p>

                     Greeks with the greatest fury. The Medes, then, having been drawn up for battle
                     in the manner we have described, attacked the defenders of Thermopylae; but
                     Leonidas had made careful preparation and massed the Greeks in the narrowest

                     were exhorted to the fray by Leonidas, it followed that the struggle was

                     considerable time the battle was equally balanced. But since the Greeks were
                     superior in valour and in the great size of their shields, the Medes gradually
                     gave way; for many of them were slain and not a few wounded. The place of the
                     Medes in the battle was taken by Cissians and Sacae, selected for their valour,
                     who had been stationed to support them; and joining the struggle fresh as they
                     were against men who were worn out they withstood the hazard of combat for a
                     short while, be as they were slain and pressed upon by the soldiers of
                     Leonidas, they gave way. </p>

                     they enjoyed an advantage in open fields, since they were thus enabled to move
                     more easily, but in narrow places they could not easily inflict wounds upon an
                     enemy who were formed in close ranks and had their entire bodies protected by
                     large shields, whereas they, being at a disadvantage by reason of the lightness
                     of their protective armour, received repeated wounds. </p>

                     the Greeks, sent forward the picked Persians known as the "Immortals," who were
                     reputed to be pre-eminent among the entire host for their deeds of courage. But
                     when these also fled after only a brief resistance, then at last, as night

                     reputed to be of outstanding bravery and daring, after an earnest exhortation
                     announced before the battle that if they should storm the approach he would

                     battle by turns would not withdraw, but by their unintermitted endurance of the

                     even the picked barbarians turned in flight, the barbarians who were stationed

                     native of the region, who was familiar with the mountainous area. This man was
                     brought into the presence of Xerxes and undertook to conduct the Persians by

                     upright in his ways, deserting from the camp of the Persians in the night came

                     When they had hastily refreshed themselves and all were ready, he ordered the
                     soldiers to attack the camp, slaying any who came in their way, and to strike

                     affairs, and the confusion, extending as it did throughout the entire
                     encampment, occasioned, we may well believe, great slaughter; since they kept

                  <p> So long as it was night they wandered throughout the entire camp seeking

                     affairs was made manifest, the Persians observing that the Greeks were few in
                     number, viewed them with contempt; the Persians did not, however, join battle

                     offered upon their own lives for the common salvation of all Greeks, and

                     For what man among the barbarians could have conceived of that which had taken
                     place? Who could have expected that a band of only five hundred ever had the
                     daring to charge against the human myriads? Consequently what man of later
                     times might not emulate the valour of those warriors who, finding themselves in
                     the grip of an overwhelming situation, though their bodies were subdued, were
                     not conquered in spirit? These men, therefore, alone of all of whom history
                     records, have in defeat been accorded a greater fame than all others who have
                     won the fairest victories. For judgement must be passed upon brave men, not by
                     the outcome of their actions, but by their purpose; </p>

                  <p> in the one case Fortune is mistress, in the other it is the purpose which wins
                     approval. What man would judge any to be braver than were those Spartans who,
                     though not equal in number to even the thousandth part of the enemy, dared to
                     match their valour against the unbelievable multitudes? Nor had they any hope
                     of overcoming so many myriads, but they believed that in bravery they would
                     surpass all men of former times, and they decided that, although the battle
                     they had to fight was against the barbarians, yet the real contest and the
                     award of valour they were seeking was in competition with all who had ever won
                     admiration for their campaign. </p>

                     feeling aggrieved that the greatest perils threatened them, but concluding that
                     the greatest boon for which those who practise valour should pray is the
                     opportunity to play a part in contests of this kind. </p>

                     at a later time in the battles against Xerxes; for when the deeds of these men
                     were called to mind, the Persians were dismayed whereas the Greeks were incited

                     not only the writers of history but also many of our poets have celebrated
                     their brave exploits; and one of them is Simonides, the lyric poet, who
                     composed the following encomium in their praise, worthy of their valour: </p>
                  <q><l>Of those who perished at Thermopylae</l>
                     <l>All glorious is the fortune, fair the doom;</l>

                     <l>Instead of lamentation, and their fate</l>
                     <l>Is chant of praise. Such winding-sheet as this</l>
                     <l>Nor mould nor all-consuming time shall waste.</l>

                     shall resume the course of our narrative. Xerxes, now that he had gained the
                     passes in the manner we have described and had won, as the proverb runs, a
                     "Cadmeian victory," had destroyed only a few of the enemy, while he had lost
                     great numbers of his own troops. And after he had become master of the passes
                     by means of his land forces, he resolved to make trial of contest at sea. </p>

                  <p> At once, therefore, summoning the commander of the fleet, Megabates, he
                     ordered him to sail against the naval force of the Greeks and to make trial,
                     with all his fleet, of a sea-battle against them. </p>

                     Macedonia with all the fleet and put in at a promontory of Magnesia which bears
                     the name of Sepias. At this place a great wind arose and he lost more than
                     three hundred warships and great numbers of cavalry transports and other
                     vessels. And when the wind ceased, he weighed anchor and put in at Aphetae in
                     Magnesia. From here he dispatched two hundred triremes, ordering the commanders
                     to take a roundabout course and, by keeping Euboea on the right, to encircle
                     the enemy. </p>

                  <p>The Greeks were stationed at Artemisium in Euboea and had in all two hundred
                     and eighty triremes; of these ships one hundred and forty were Athenian and the
                     remainder were furnished by the rest of the Greeks. Their admiral was
                     Eurybiades the Spartan, and Themistocles the Athenian supervised the affairs of
                     the fleet; for the latter, by reason of his sagacity and skill as a general,
                     enjoyed great favour not only with the Greeks throughout the fleet but also
                     with Eurybiades himself, and all men looked to him and harkened to him eagerly.

                  <p> And when a meeting of the commanders of the ships was held to discuss the
                     engagement, the rest of them all favoured waiting to receive the advance of the
                     enemy; but Themistocles alone expressed the opposite opinion, showing them that
                     it was to their advantage to sail against the enemy with the whole fleet in one
                     array; for in this way, he declared, they would have the upper hand, attacking
                     as they would with their ships in a single body an enemy whose formation was
                     broken by disorder, as it must be, for they would be issuing out of many
                     harbours at some distance apart. In the end the Greeks followed the opinion of
                     meantime and sailed against the enemy with the entire fleet. </p>

                     Themistocles, engaging with the scattered Persians, sank many ships and not a
                     few he forced to turn in flight and pursued as far as the land; but later, when
                     the whole fleet had gathered and a fierce battle ensued, each side gained the
                     superiority in one part of the line but neither won a complete victory, and at
                     nightfall the engagement was broken off. </p>

                  <p> After the battle a great storm arose and destroyed many ships which were
                     anchored outside the harbour, so that it appeared as if Providence were taking
                     the part of the Greeks in order that, the multitude of the barbarians' ships
                     having been lessened, the Greek force might become a match for them and strong
                     enough to offer battle. As a result the Greeks grew ever more bold, whereas the
                     barbarians became ever more timorous before the conflicts which faced them.
                     Nevertheless, recovering themselves after the shipwreck, they put out with all
                     their ships against the enemy. </p>

                  <p> And the Greeks, with fifty Attic triremes added to their number, took position
                     opposed to the barbarians. The sea-battle which followed was much like the
                     fighting at Thermopylae; for the Persians were resolved to overwhelm the Greeks
                     and force their way through the Euripus, while the Greeks, blocking the
                     narrows, were fighting to preserve their allies in Euboea. A fierce battle
                     ensued and many ships were lost on both sides, and nightfall compelled them to
                     return to their respective harbours. The prize of valour, we are told, in both
                     battles was accorded to the Athenians for the Greeks and to the Sidonians for
                     the barbarians. </p>

                     dispirited; consequently they sailed off to Salamis and awaited events there.

                     destroying all property in the countryside. Now the Phocians had chosen the
                     cause of the Greeks, but seeing that they were unable to offer resistance, the
                     whole populace deserted all are cities and fled for safety to the rugged

                     of these two cities had fled in a body to the Peloponnesus. After this he
                     entered Attica and ravaged the countryside, and then he razed Athens to the
                     ground and sent up in flames the temples of the gods. And while the king was
                     concerned with these affairs, his fleet sailed from Euboea to Attica, having
                     sacked on the way both Euboea and the coast of Attica. </p>

                     the promontory at Malea, but, as certain historians tell us, anxiously awaiting
                     the turn of the war, in order that, if the Persians prevailed, they might then
                     give them water and earth, while if the Greeks were victorious, they would get

                     were exceedingly disheartened. And likewise great fear gripped the other Greeks
                     who, driven from every quarter, were now cooped up in the Peloponnesus alone.
                     Consequently they thought it desirable that all who had been charged with
                     command should meet in council and deliberate regarding the kind of place that
                     would best serve their purpose in fighting a naval battle. </p>

                  <p> Many ideas of various kinds were expressed. The Peloponnesians, thinking only
                     of their own safety, declared that the contest should be held at the Isthmus;
                     for it had been strongly fortified with a wall, and so, if they should suffer
                     any reverse in the battle, the defeated would be able to withdraw for refuge
                     into the most suitable place of safety available, the Peloponnesus, whereas, if
                     they cooped themselves up in the little island of Salamis, perils would beset
                     them from which it would be difficult for them to be rescued. </p>

               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p> But Themistocles counselled that the contest of the ships be held at Salamis,
                     for he believed that those who had few ships to fight with would have many
                     advantages, in the narrows of Salamis, against a vastly superior number of
                     vessels. And speaking generally, he showed that the region about the Isthmus
                     would be altogether unsuitable for the sea-battle; for the contest would take
                     place on the open sea, and the Persians because of the room for manoeuvring
                     would easily subdue the small force of ships by their vastly superior numbers.
                     And by presenting in like fashion many other facts pertinent to the occasion he
                     persuaded all present to cast their votes with him for the plan he recommended.

                  <p> When at last a decision was reached by all to fight the sea-battle at Salamis,
                     the Greeks set about making the preparations necessary to meet the Persians and
                     the peril of battle. Accordingly Eurybiades, accompanied by Themistocles,
                     undertook to encourage the crews and incite them to face the impending
                     struggle. However, the crews would not heed them, but since they were one and
                     all dismayed at the magnitude of the Persian forces, not a man of them paid any
                     attention to his commander, every one being intent upon sailing from Salamis to
                     the Peloponnesus. </p>

                  <p> And the army of the Greeks on land was no whit less terrified by the armament
                     of the enemy, and not only the loss at Thermopylae of their most illustrious
                     warriors caused them dismay, but also the disasters which were taking place in
                     Attica before their very eyes were filling the Greeks with utter despair. </p>

                  <p> Meanwhile the members of the congress of the Greeks, observing the unrest of
                     the masses and the dismay prevailing everywhere, voted to build a wall across
                     the Isthmus. The works were completed speedily because of the enthusiasm and
                     the multitude of those engaged in the task; but while the Peloponnesians were
                     strengthening the wall, which extended a distance of forty stades, from
                     Lechaeum to Cenchreae, the forces which were inactive at Salamis, together with
                     the entire fleet, were so terror-stricken that they no longer obeyed the orders

                  <p> Themistocles, perceiving that the admiral, Eurybiades, was unable to overcome
                     the mood of his forces, and yet recognizing that the narrow quarters at Salamis
                     could be a great aid in accomplishing the victory, contrived the following
                     ruse: He induced a certain man to desert to Xerxes and to assure him that the
                     ships at Salamis were going to slip away from that region and assemble at the
                     Isthmus. </p>

                  <p> Accordingly the king, believing the man because what he reported was in itself
                     plausible, made haste to prevent the naval forces of the Greeks from making
                     contact with their armies on land. Therefore he at once dispatched the Egyptian
                     fleet with orders to block the strait which separates Salamis from the
                     territory of Megaris. The main body of his ships he dispatched to Salamis,
                     ordering it to establish contact with the enemy and by fighting there decide
                     the issue. The triremes were drawn up by peoples one after another, in order
                     that, speaking the same language and knowing one another, the several
                     contingents might assist each other with alacrity. </p>

                     Persians. </p>
                  <p>The commanders of Ionian contingents of the Persian fleet sent a man of Samos
                     to the Greeks to inform them of what the king had decided to do and of the
                     disposition of his forces for battle, and to say that in the course of the
                     battle they were going to desert from the barbarians.</p>

                     worked out as he had planned, was beside himself with joy and exhorted the
                     crews to the fight; and as for the Greeks, they were emboldened by the promise
                     of the Ionians, and although the circumstances were compelling them to fight
                     against their own preference, they came down eagerly in a body from Salamis to
                     the shore in preparation for the sea-battle.</p>

                     their forces, the left wing was held by the Athenians and Lacedaemonians, who
                     in this way would be opposed to the ships of the Phoenicians; for the
                     Phoenicians possessed a distinct superiority by reason of both of their great
                     number and of the experience in seamanship which they inherited from their

                     they would show the best spirit, seeing that they alone of the Greeks would
                     have no place of refuge in case any reverse should occur in the course of the
                     battle. The centre was held by the rest of the Greek forces. </p>
                  <p>This, then, was the battle-order in which the Greeks sailed out, and they

                     compelled to withdraw some ships from the line, creating in this way much

                     his ship went down, disorder seized the barbarian fleet, for there were many
                     now to give orders, but each man did not issue the same commands. Consequently
                     they halted the advance, and holding back their ships, they began to withdraw

                     were time and again severely damaged by the beaks of the ships. Consequently

                     upon the rest the punishment they deserved. And the Phoenicians, frightened by
                     his threats, first put into port on the coast of Attica, and then, when night

                     devised another stratagem no less clever than the one we have described. For,
                     since the Greeks were afraid to battle on land against so many myriads of
                     Persians, he greatly reduced the number of the Persian troops in the following
                     manner: he sent to Xerxes the attendant of his own sons to inform him that the
                     Greeks were about to sail to the bridge of boats and to destroy it. </p>
               </div>
               <div

                  <p> Accordingly the king, believing the report because it was plausible, became
                     fearful lest he should be cut off from the route whatever he could get back to
                     Asia, now that the Greeks controlled the sea, and decided to cross over in all
                     possible haste from Europe into Asia, leaving Mardonius behind in Greece with
                     picked cavalry and infantry, the total number of whom was not less than four
                     hundred thousand. Thus Themistocles by the use of two stratagems brought about
                     signal advantages for the Greeks. </p>

                     shift our narrative to the affairs of another people. The Carthaginians, we
                     recall, had agreed with the Persians to subdue the Greeks of Sicily at the same
                     time and had made preparations on a large scale of such materials as would be
                     useful in carrying on a war. And when they had made everything ready, they
                     chose for general Hamilcar, having selected him as the man who was held by them
                     in the highest esteem. </p>

               <div

                  <p> He assumed command of huge forces, both land and naval, and sailed forth from
                     Carthage with an army of not less than three hundred thousand men and a fleet
                     of over two hundred ships of war, not to mention many cargo ships for carrying
                     supplies, numbering more than three thousand. Now as he was crossing the Libyan
                     sea he encountered a storm and lost the vessels which were carrying the horses
                     and chariots. And when he came to port in Sicily in the harbour of Panormus he
                     remarked that he had finished the war; for he had been afraid that the sea
                     would rescue the Siceliotes from the perils of the conflict.</p>

                  <p>He took three days to rest his soldiers and to repair the damage which the

                     against Himera, the fleet skirting the coast with him. And when he had arrived
                     near the city we have just mentioned, he pitched two camps, the one for the
                     army and the other for the naval force. All the warships he hauled up on land
                     and threw about them a deep ditch and a wooden palisade, and he strengthened
                     the camp of the army, which he placed so that it fronted the city, and
                     prolonged so that it took in the area from the wall extending along the naval
                     camp as far as the hills which overhung the city.</p>

                     unloaded all the supplies from the cargo vessels and at once sent off all these
                     boats, ordering them to bring grain and the other supplies from Libya and

                     inhabitants of the city with terror. Consequently Theron, the ruler of the
                     Acragantini, who with a considerable force was standing by to guard Himera, in
                     fear hastily sent word to Syracuse, asking Gelon to come to his aid as rapidly

                     his entire body of cavalry against such forces of the enemy as were ranging
                     over the countryside in search of booty. And the cavalry, unexpectedly
                     appearing to men who were scattered without military order over the
                     countryside, took prisoner as many as each man could drive before him. And when
                     prisoners of the number of more than ten thousand had been brought into the
                     city, not only was Gelon accorded great approbation but the Himerans also came

                     Gelon through his contempt of the enemy, and he even constructed additional

                     Poseidon, cavalrymen came from the countryside bringing to Gelon a
                     letter-carrier who was conveying dispatches from the people of Selinus, in
                     which was written that they would send the cavalry for that day for which

                     they were the allies from Selinus, and when they had once got inside the wooden
                     palisade, to slay Hamilcar and set fire to the ships. He also sent scouts to

                     they saw that the horsemen were inside the wall. For his part, at daybreak he

                  <p>And the reason is that, when the people of Greece on the one hand and those of
                     Sicily on the other were struck with dismay before the conflict at the
                     multitude of the barbarian armies, it was the prior victory of the Sicilian
                     Greeks which gave courage to the people of Greece when they learned of Gelon's
                     victory; and as for the men in both affairs who held the supreme command, we
                     know that in the case of the Persians the king escaped with his life and many
                     myriads together with him, whereas in the case of the Carthaginians not only
                     did the general perish but also everyone who participated in the war was slain,
                     and, as the saying is, not even a man to bear the news got back alive to

                     and Themistocles, the former was put to death by his fellow citizens because of
                     his overweening greed of power and treason, and the latter was driven from
                     every corner of Greece and fled for refuge to Xerxes, his bitterest enemy, on
                     whose hospitality he lived to the end of his life; whereas Gelon after the
                     battle received greater approbation every year at the hands of the Syracusans,
                     grew old in the kingship, and died in the esteem of his people, and so strong
                     was the goodwill which the citizens felt for him that the kingship was

                  <p>After the battle at the city of the Himerans twenty warships made their escape

                     had not hauled up on shore. Consequently, although practically all the rest of
                     the combatants were either slain or taken prisoner, these vessels managed to
                     set sail before they were noticed. But they picked up many fugitives, and while
                     heavily laden on this account, they encountered a storm and were all lost. A
                     handful only of survivors got safely to Carthage in a small boat to give their
                     fellow citizens a statement which was brief: "All who crossed over to Sicily

                     city, in the belief that Gelon with his entire force must have decided to sail
                     forthwith against Carthage. And because of the multitude of the lost the city
                     went into public mourning, while privately the homes of citizens were filled
                     with wailing and lamentation. For some kept inquiring after sons, others after
                     brothers, while a very large number of children who had lost their fathers,
                     alone now in the world, grieved at the death of those who had begotten them and
                     at their own desolation through the loss of those who could succour them. And
                     the Carthaginians, fearing lest Gelon should forestall them in crossing over to
                     Libya, at once dispatched to him as ambassadors plenipotentiary their ablest
                     orators and counsellors. </p>

                     who had played the part of men. The fairest part of the booty he put to one
                     side, since he wished to embellish the temples of Syracuse with the spoils; as
                     for the rest of the booty, much of it he nailed to the most notable of the
                     temples in Himera, and the rest of it, together with the captives, he divided

                     Acragantini, who embellished their city and countryside; for so great was the
                     multitude of prisoners at their disposal that many private citizens had five
                     hundred captives in their homes. A contributing reason for the vast number of
                     the captives among them was not only that they had sent many soldiers into the
                     battle, but also that, when the flight took place, many of the fugitives turned
                     into the interior, especially into the territory of the Acragantini, and since
                     every man of them was taken captive by the Acragantini, the city was crammed
                     full of the captured.</p>

                     city; these are so large that their construction is well worth seeing, although
                     it is little thought of since they were built at slight expense. The builder in

                     springs were conducted and it became a fish-pond, which supplied fish in great
                     abundance to be used for food and to please the plate; and since swans also in
                     the greatest numbers settled down upon it, the pool came to be a delight to
                     look upon. In later years, however, the pool became choked up through neglect

                     force and to join the Greeks in their war against the Persians.</p>

                     allies who have perished in the battle; and if I overcome the barbarians in the

                  <p>The Thebans received the fugitives, added them to their forces, and then set

                     to miscalculation from happening, the barbarians being many times more numerous

                     soon there was an incredible number of dead. And in the end, when the Greeks
                     had slaughtered more than one hundred thousand of the barbarians, they

                     hauled up their ships, since they saw that the vessels were unequal to offering
                     battle, and threw about them a wooden palisade and a deep ditch; despite these
                     defences they also summoned land forces from Sardis and the neighbouring cities
                     and gathered in all about one hundred thousand men. Furthermore, they made

                  <p>Leotychides advanced with all the fleet ready for action against the barbarians
                     at Mycalê, dispatching in advance a ship carrying a herald who had the
                     strongest voice of anyone in the fleet. This man had been ordered to sail up to
                     the enemy and to announce in a loud voice, "The Greeks, having conquered the

                     in the camp of the barbarians; and that is what actually happened. For as soon
                     as the herald approached the ships which had been hauled up on the shore, and
                     made the announcement as he had been ordered, it came about that the Persians

                     while they were making preparation for battle, the rumour came to them of the

                     announced in histrionic manner the victory of Plataea, in the belief that he
                     would make more confident those who were about to fight. And marvellous indeed
                     was the outcome. For it has become known that it was on the same day that the
                     two battles took place, the one which was fought at Mycalê and the other which
                     occurred at Plataea.</p>

                     them; and then they called all the soldiers together and told them that Xerxes
                     was coming in person to their aid with a great armament, inspiring them thereby

                     participated in the battle, after the issue had already been decided, as well
                     as many other peoples of Asia, since an overwhelming desire for their liberty

                     flight. This was the manner in which the Persians suffered defeat, and there
                     were slain of them more than forty thousand, while of the survivors some found

                     from Lacedaemon, and in the meantime to put the whole population to work

                     denunciations and threats of violence upbraided them, the Athenians took them

                     his native state. Thus the Peiraeus, as it is called, was not at that time a

                     Phaleric, which was quite small; and so Themistocles conceived the plan of
                     making the Peiraeus into a harbour, since it would require only a small amount
                     of construction and could be made into a harbour, the best and largest in

                     other Greeks of Asia, who would then turn in goodwill to the Athenians because
                     of this benefaction, and that all the Greeks of the islands, being immensely
                     impressed by the magnitude of their naval strength, would readily align
                     themselves with the people which had the power both to inflict the greatest

                     would endeavour to stop it; and so he announced to the citizens in Assembly
                     that he wished both to advise upon and to introduce important matters which
                     were also to the advantage of the city. But what these matters were, he added,
                     it was not in the public interest to state openly, but it was fitting that a
                     few men should be charged with putting them into effect; and he therefore asked

                     they urged him to declare openly what he had decided upon. But he made this

                     Lacedaemonians had interfered with the building of the wall about the city,
                     they would in the same manner endeavour to obstruct the plans of the Athenians
                     in the case of the making of the harbour.</p>

               <div

                  <p>Accordingly he decided to dispatch ambassadors to the Lacedaemonians to show
                     them how it was to the advantage of the common interests of Greece that it
                     should possess a first-rate harbour in view of the expedition which was to be
                     expected on the part of the Persians. When he had in this way somewhat dulled
                     the impulse of the Spartans to interfere, he devoted himself to that work, and
                     since everybody enthusiastically co‑operated it was speedily done and the
                     harbour was finished before anyone expected.</p>

                  <p>And Themistocles persuaded the people each year to construct and add twenty
                     triremes to the fleet they already possessed, and also to remove the tax upon
                     metics and artisans, in order that great character crowds of people might
                     stream into the city from every quarter and that the Athenians might easily
                     procure labour for a great number of crafts. Both these policies he considered
                     to be most useful in building up the city's naval forces. The Athenians,
                     therefore, were busy over the matters we have described. </p>

                     which were still held by barbarian garrisons.</p>

                     liberated those cities which still had Persian garrisons;</p>

                     expelled, and thus liberated the city, but many important Persians whom he
                     captured in the city he turned over to Gongylus of Eretria to guard. Ostensibly
                     Gongylus was to keep these men for punishment, but actually he was to get them
                     off safe to Xerxes; for Pausanias had secretly made a pact of friendship with
                     the king and was about to marry the daughter of Xerxes, his purpose being to
                     betray the Greeks.</p>

                     corrupting such Greeks as could serve their ends. </p>
                  <p>The plan of Pausanias, however, was brought to light and he got his punishment

                     and by cities, were railing at the harshness of Pausanias, some Peloponnesians
                     deserted him and sailed back to the Peloponnesus, and dispatching ambassadors
                     to Sparta they lodged an accusation against Pausanias; and Aristeides the
                     Athenian, making wise use of the opportunity, in the course of his public
                     conferences with the states won them over and by his personal intimacy with
                     them made them adherents of the Athenians. But even more did matters play by

                  <p> Pausanias had stipulated that the men who carried the messages from him to the
                     king should not return and thus become betrayers of their secret
                     communications; consequently, since they were being put to death by the
                     receivers of the letters, no one of them was ever returning alive.</p>

                     certain other Spartans; and when Pausanias came to him and asked why he was a
                     suppliant, the man upbraided him for directing in the letter that he should be

                     mistake; he even implored him to help keep the matter secret, promising him
                     great gifts, and the two then parted. As for the ephors and the others with
                     them, although they had learned the precise truth, at that time they held their
                     peace, but on a later occasion, when the Lacedaemonians were taking up the
                     matter together with the ephors, Pausanias learned of it in advance, acted
                     first, and fled for safety into the temple of Athena of the Brazen House.</p>

                  <p> And while the Lacedaemonians were hesitating whether to punish him now that he
                     was a suppliant, we are told that the mother of Pausanias, coming to the
                     temple, neither said nor did anything else than to pick up a brick and lay it
                     against the entrance of the temple, and after she had done this she returned to

                     entrance and in this manner forced Pausanias to meet his end through
                     starvation. Now the body of the dead man was turned over to his relatives for
                     burial; but the divinity showed its displeasure at the violation of the

                     injunction of the god. Concluding, however, to do as much as was within their
                     power, they made two bronze statues of Pausanias and set them up in the temple

                     all had reason to emulate the customs of the barbarians; for he had not learned
                     of them from others, but in person by actual contact he had made trial of them
                     and was aware how greatly superior with respect to virtue his ancestors' way of

                     lost the supremacy at sea. In comparison, for instance, take the fine tact of
                     Aristeides in dealing with the allies: when they took note of it, both because
                     of his affability toward his subordinates and his uprightness in general, it

                     to him in every matter and thus brought it about that he received the supreme

                     to deposit there all the money they collected, and towards the war which they

                     he was considered to have accomplished an impossible thing, he won for himself
                     a very high reputation for justice, and because he excelled in that virtue he

                     got the largest number of ostraca was obliged by the law to go into exile from
                     his native land for a period of five years.</p>

                  <p>The Athenians, it appears, passed such a law, not for the purpose of punishing
                     wrongdoing, but in order to lower through exile the presumption of men who had
                     risen too high. Now Themistocles, having been ostracized in the manner we have
                     described, fled as an exile from his native city to Argos. But the
                     Lacedaemonians, learning of this and considering that Fortune had given them a
                     favourable moment to attack Themistocles, again dispatched ambassadors to
                     Athens. These accused Themistocles of complicity in the treason of Pausanias,
                     and asserted that his trial, since his crimes affected all Greece, should not
                     be held privately among the Athenians alone but rather before the General
                     Congress of the Greeks which, according to custom, was to meet at that time.

                  <p>And Themistocles, seeing that the Lacedaemonians were bent upon defaming and
                     humbling the Athenian state, and that the Athenians were anxious to clear
                     themselves of the charge against them, assumed that he would be turned over to
                     the General Congress.</p>

                  <p>This body, he knew, made its decisions, not on the basis of justice, but out of
                     favour to the Lacedaemonians, inferring this not only from its other actions
                     but also from what it had done in making the awards for valour. For in that
                     instance those who controlled the voting showed such jealousy of the Athenians
                     that, although these had contributed more triremes than all the others who took
                     part in the battle, they made them out to be no whit better than the rest of
                     the Greeks.</p>

                  <p>These, then, were the reasons why Themistocles distrusted the members of the
                     Congress. Furthermore, it was from the speech in his own defence which
                     Themistocles had made in Athens on the former occasion that the Lacedaemonians
                     had got the basis for the accusation they afterwards made.</p>

                  <p>For in that defence Themistocles had acknowledged that Pausanias had sent
                     letters to him, urging him to share in the act of treason, and using this as
                     the strongest piece of evidence in his behalf, he had established that
                     Pausanias would not have urged him, unless he had opposed his first request.

                     Argos to Admetus, the king of the Molossians; and taking refuge at Admetus'
                     hearth he became his suppliant. The king at first received him kindly, urged
                     him to be of good courage, and, in general, assured him that he would provide
                     for his safety;</p>

                     punishment, stigmatizing him as the betrayer and destroyer of the whole Greek
                     world, and when they went further and declared that, if Admetus would not turn
                     him over to them, they together with all the Greeks would make war on him, then
                     indeed the king, fearing on the one hand the threats and yet pitying the
                     suppliant and seeking to avoid the disgrace of handing him over, persuaded
                     Themistocles to make his escape with all speed without the knowledge of the
                     Lacedaemonians and gave him a large sum of gold to meet his expenses on the

                     and fled by night out of the territory of the Molossians, the king furthering
                     his flight in every way; and finding two young men, Lyncestians by birth, who
                     were traders and therefore familiar with the roads, he made his escape in their

                     goodwill of the young men and the hardship they endured for him he made his way
                     to Asia. Here Themistocles had a personal friend, Lysitheides by name, who was
                     highly regarded for his fame and wealth, and to him he fled for refuge. </p>

                     occasion of his passage through Asia Minor had entertained the entire Persian
                     host. Consequently, since he enjoyed an intimate acquaintance with the king and
                     yet wished out of mercy to save Themistocles, he promised to co‑operate with

                     explaining that Themistocles would be punished because of his past activities
                     against the Persians; later, however, when he realized that it was for the
                     best, he acceded, and unexpectedly and without harm he got him through safe to

                     came face to face with the passenger; and it came about that Lysitheides
                     availed himself of this means of carrying out his undertaking.</p>

                     into the presence of the king, and after he had conversed with him cautiously
                     he received pledges from the king that he would do Themistocles no wrong. Then
                     Lysitheides introduced him to the presence of the king, who, when he had
                     allowed Themistocles to speak and learned that he had done the king no wrong,

                     Mandanê was the daughter of the Darius who had slain the Magi and the full
                     sister of Xerxes, and she enjoyed high esteem among the Persians.</p>

                     in the sea-battle at Salamis and sorely grieved over the death of her children,
                     and because of her great affliction she was the object of the pity of the

                     upon Themistocles. And when the king paid no heed to her, she visited in turn
                     the noblest Persians with her request and, speaking generally, spurred on the
                     people to wreak vengeance upon Themistocles.</p>

                     noblest Persians and that its verdict would be carried out.</p>

                     language, and using it in his defence he was acquitted of the charges.</p>

                     with great gifts; so, for example, he gave him in marriage a Persian woman, who
                     was of outstanding birth and beauty and, besides, praised for her virtue, and
                     [she brought as her dower] not only a multitude of household slaves for their

                     had more grain than any city of Asia, for bread, Myus for meat, since the sea

                  <p>And Cimon, taking along the fleet which was at Byzantium and putting in at the
                     city which is called Eïon, took it from the Persians who were holding it and
                     captured by siege Scyros, which was inhabited by Pelasgians and Dolopes; and
                     setting up an Athenian as the founder of a colony he portioned out the land in

                  <p>After this, with a mind to begin greater enterprises, he put in at the
                     Peiraeus, and after adding more triremes to his fleet and arranging for general
                     supplies on a notable scale, he at that time put to sea with two hundred
                     triremes; but later, when he had called for additional ships from the Ionians
                     and everyone else, he had in all three hundred.</p>

                  <p>So sailing with the entire fleet to Caria he at once succeeded in persuading
                     the cities on the coast which had been settled from Greece to revolt from the
                     Persians, but as for the cities whose inhabitants spoke two languages and still
                     had Persian garrisons, he had recourse to force and laid siege to them; then,
                     after he had brought to his side the cities of Caria, he likewise won over by
                     persuasion those of Lycia.</p>

               <div

                  <p>Also, by taking additional ships from the allies, who were continually being
                     added, he still further increased the size of the fleet. Now the Persians had
                     composed their land forces from their own peoples, but their navy they had
                     gathered from both Phoenicia and Cyprus and Cilicia, and the commander of the
                     Persian armaments was Tithraustes, who was an illegitimate son of Xerxes.</p>

                  <p>And when Cimon learned that the Persian fleet was lying off Cyprus, sailing
                     against the barbarians he engaged them in battle, pitting two hundred and fifty
                     ships against three hundred and forty. A sharp struggle took place and both
                     fleets fought brilliantly, but in the end the Athenians were victorious, having
                     destroyed many of the enemy ships and captured more than one hundred together
                     with their crews.</p>

                  <p>The rest of the ships escaped to Cyprus, where their crews left them and took
                     to the land, and the ships, being bare of defenders, fell into the hands of the

                     encamped on the bank of the Eurymedon River. And wishing to overcome the
                     barbarians by a stratagem, he manned the captured Persian ships with his own
                     best men, giving them tiaras for their heads and clothing them in the Persian
                     fashion generally.</p>

                  <p>The barbarians, so soon as the fleet approached them, were deceived by the
                     Persian ships and garb and supposed the triremes to be their own. Consequently
                     they received the Athenians as if they were friends. And Cimon, night having
                     fallen, disembarked his soldiers, and being received by the Persians as a
                     friend, he fell upon their encampment.</p>

                  n="3">
                  <p>A great tumult arose among the Persians, and the soldiers of Cimon cut down all
                     who came in their way, and seizing in his tent Pheredates, one of the two
                     generals of the barbarians and a nephew of the king, they slew him; and as for
                     the rest of the Persians, some they cut down and others they wounded, and all
                     of them, because of the unexpectedness of the attack, they forced to take
                     flight. In a word, such consternation as well as bewilderment prevailed among
                     the Persians that most of them did not even know who it was that was attacking
                     them.</p>

               <div

                  <p>For they had no idea that the Greeks had come against them in force, being
                     persuaded that they had no land army at all; and they assumed that it was the
                     Pisidians, who dwelt in neighbouring territory and were hostile to them, who
                     had come to attack them. Consequently, thinking that the attack of the enemy
                     was coming from the mainland, they fled to their ships in the belief they were
                     in friendly hands.</p>

               <div

                  <p>And since it was a dark night without a moon, their bewilderment was increased
                     all the more and not a man was able to discern the true state of affairs.</p>

               <div
                  n="6">
                  <p>Consequently, after a great slaughter had occurred on account of the disorder
                     among the barbarians, Cimon, who had previously given orders to the soldiers to
                     come running to the torch which would be raised, had the signal raised beside
                     the ships, being anxious lest, if the soldiers should scatter and turn to
                     plundering, some miscarriage of his plans might occur.</p>

                  <p> And when the soldiers had all been gathered at the torch and had stopped
                     plundering, for the time being they set up a trophy and then sailed back to
                     Cyprus, having won two glorious victories, the one on land and the other on the
                     sea; for not to this day has history recorded the occurrence of so unusual and
                     so important actions on the same day by a host that fought both afloat and on
                     land. </p>

                  <p> After Cimon had won these great successes by means of his own skill as general
                     and his valour, his fame was noised abroad not only among his fellow citizens
                     but among all other Greeks as well. For he had captured three hundred and forty
                     ships, more than twenty thousand men, and a considerable sum of money.</p>

                  <p>But the Persians, having met with so great reverses, built other triremes in
                     greater number, since they feared the growing might of the Athenians. For from
                     this time the Athenian state kept receiving significant enhancement of its
                     power, supplied as it was with an abundance of funds and having attained to
                     great renown for courage and for able leadership in war.</p>

                  <p>When Phaeon was archon in Athens, in Rome the consulship was taken over by
                     Lucius Furius Mediolanus and Marcus Manilius Vaso. During this year a great and
                     incredible catastrophe befell the Lacedaemonians; for great earthquakes
                     occurred in Sparta, and as a result the houses collapsed from their foundations
                     and more than twenty thousand Lacedaemonians perished.</p>

               <div

                  <p>And since the tumbling down of the city and the falling in of the houses
                     continued uninterruptedly over a long period, many persons were caught and
                     crushed in the collapse of the walls and no little household property was
                     ruined by the quake.</p>

                  <p>And although they suffered this disaster because some god, as it were, was
                     wreaking his anger upon them, it so happened that other dangers befell them at
                     the hands of men for the following reasons.</p>

               <div

                  <p>The Helots and Messenians, although enemies of the Lacedaemonians, had remained
                     quiet up to this time, since they stood in fear of the eminent position and
                     power of Sparta; but when they observed that the larger part of them had
                     perished because of the earthquake, they held in contempt the survivors, who
                     were few. Consequently they came to an agreement with each other and joined
                     together in the war against the Lacedaemonians.</p>

                  <p> The king of the Lacedaemonians, Archidamus, by his personal foresight not only
                     was the saviour of his fellow citizens even during the earthquake, but in the
                     course of the war also he bravely fought the aggressors.</p>

                     defend it; but when they heard that the survivors were drawn up in a body with
                     Archidamus the king and were ready for the struggle on behalf of their native
                     land, they gave up this plan, and seizing a stronghold in Messenia they made it

                     became able to meet their enemy on equal terms. At the outset they were much
                     superior to the enemy, but at a later time, when a suspicion arose that the
                     Athenians were about to go over to the Messenians, they broke the alliance with
                     them, stating as their reason that in the other allies they had sufficient men

                     time did no more than withdraw; later, however, their relations to the
                     Lacedaemonians being unfriendly, they were more and more inclined to fan the
                     flames of hatred. Consequently the Athenians took this incident as the first
                     cause of the estrangement of the two states, and later on they quarrelled and,
                     embarking upon great wars, filled all Greece with vast calamities. But we shall
                     give an account of these matters severally in connection with the appropriate

                     they were winning and at another losing. And since for ten years no decision
                     could be reached in the war, for that length of time they never ceased injuring

                     won the "stadion." In this year a war broke out between the Argives and
                     Mycenaeans for the following reasons.</p>

                     maintained an independent position and would take no orders from the Argives;
                     and they kept disputing with them also over the shrine of Hera and claiming
                     that they had the right to administer the Nemean Games by themselves.
                     Furthermore, when the Argives voted not to join with the Lacedaemonians in the
                     battle at Thermopylae unless they were given a share in the supreme command,
                     the Mycenaeans were the only people of Argolis who fought at the side of the

                     Mycenae, dispute the right of Argos to the leadership. Such, then, were the
                     reasons for the bad blood between them; and from of old the Argives had ever
                     been eager to exalt their city, and now they thought they had a favourable
                     opportunity, seeing that the Lacedaemonians had been weakened and were unable
                     to come to the aid of the Mycenaeans. Therefore the Argives, gathering a strong
                     army from both Argos and the cities of their allies, marched against the
                     Mycenaeans, and after defeating them in battle and shutting them within their
                     walls, they laid siege to the city.</p>

                  <p>The Mycenaeans for a time resisted the besiegers with vigour, but afterwards,
                     since they were being worsted in the fighting and the Lacedaemonians could
                     bring them no aid because of their own wars and the disaster that had overtaken
                     them in the earthquakes, and since there were no other allies, they were taken
                     by storm through lack of support from outside.</p>

                  <p> The Argives sold the Mycenaeans into slavery, dedicated a tenth part of them
                     to the god, and razed Mycenae. So this city, which in ancient times had enjoyed
                     such felicity, possessing great men and having to its credit memorable
                     achievements, met with such an end, and has remained uninhabited down to our
                     own times. </p>

                     the Syracusans, summoning to Syracuse the sons of Anaxilas, the former tyrant
                     of Zanclê, and giving them great gifts, reminded them of the benefactions Gelon
                     had rendered their father, and advised them, now that they had come of age, to
                     require an accounting of Micythus, their guardian, and themselves to take over

                     together the old family friends of the children and rendered so honest an
                     accounting that all present were filled with admiration of both his justice and
                     good faith; and the children, regretting the steps they had taken, begged
                     Micythus to take back the administration and to conduct the affairs of the
                     state with a father's power and position.</p>

                     over to them punctiliously and putting his own goods aboard a boat he set sail
                     from Rhegium, accompanied by the goodwill of the populace; and reaching Greece
                     he spent the rest of his life in Tegea in Arcadia, enjoying the approval of

                     ruled eleven years, and he left the kingdom to his brother Thrasybulus, who
                     ruled over the Syracusans for one year. </p>

                     king of the Syracusans, was driven from his throne, and since we are writing a
                     detailed account of this event, we must go back a few years and set forth
                     clearly the whole story from the beginning. </p>

                     great battle, as has been told; and since he treated the peoples whom he had
                     subdued with fairness and, in general, conducted himself humanely toward all
                     his immediate neighbours, he enjoyed high favour among the Sicilian Greeks.</p>

                     uninterrupted peace until his death. But Hieron, the next oldest among the
                     brothers, who succeeded to the throne, did not rule over his subjects in the
                     same manner;</p>

                     sincerity and nobility of character. Consequently there were a good many who
                     wished to revolt, but they restrained their inclinations because of Gelon's
                     reputation and the goodwill he had shown towards all the Sicilian Greeks.</p>

                     the throne, surpassed in wickedness his predecessor in the kingship. For being
                     a violent man and murderous by nature, he put to death many citizens unjustly
                     and drove not a few into exile on false charges, confiscating their possessions
                     into the royal treasury; and since, speaking generally, he hated those he had
                     wronged and was hated by them, he enlisted a large body of mercenaries,
                     preparing in this way a legion with which to oppose the citizen soldiery.</p>

                     outraging many and executing others, he compelled the victims to revolt.
                     Consequently the Syracusans, choosing men who would take the lead, set about as
                     one man to destroy the tyranny, and once they had been organized by their
                     leaders they clung stubbornly to their freedom.</p>

                  <p>When Thrasybulus saw that the whole city was in arms against him, he at first
                     attempted to stop the revolt by persuasion; but after he observed that the
                     movement of the Syracusans could not be halted, he gathered together both the
                     colonists whom Hieron had settled in Catana and his other allies, as well as a
                     multitude of mercenaries, so that his army numbered all told almost fifteen

                  <p>Then, seizing Achradinê, as it is called, and the Island, which was fortified,

                  <p> The Syracusans at the outset seized a part of the city which is called Tychê,
                     and operating from there they dispatched ambassadors to Gela, Acragas, and
                     Selinus, and also to Himera and the cities of the Siceli in the interior of the
                     island, asking them to come together with all speed and join with them in

                  <p>And since all these cities acceded to this request eagerly and hurriedly
                     dispatched aid, some of them infantry and cavalry and others warships fully
                     equipped for action, in a brief time there was collected a considerable
                     armament with which to aid the Syracusans. Consequently the Syracusans, having
                     made ready their ships and drawn up their army for battle, demonstrated that
                     they were ready to fight to a finish both on land and on sea. </p>

                     upon the mercenaries, was master only of Achradinê and the Island, whereas the
                     rest of the city was in the hands of the Syracusans. And after this Thrasybulus
                     sailed forth with his ships against the enemy, and after suffering defeat in
                     the battle with the loss of numerous triremes, he withdrew with the remaining
                     ships to the Island.</p>

                  <p>Similarly he led forth his army also from Achradinê and drew them up for battle
                     in the suburbs, but he suffered defeat and was forced to retire with heavy
                     losses back to Achradinê. In the end, giving up hope of maintaining the
                     tyranny, he opened negotiations with the Syracusans, came to an understanding
                     with them, and retired under a truce to Locris.</p>

                     other cities, which were either in the hands of tyrants or had garrisons, and
                     re‑established democracies in them.</p>

                     Darius the eldest and Artaxerxes, who were both living in the palace, and the
                     third, Hystaspes, who happened to be away from home at the time, since he was

                     should ascend the throne after punishing the murderer of his father; and he

                     prospering, he called his own sons to his side and crying out that now was his

                     his father, took over the kingship of the Persians. So Xerxes died in the

                     Egyptians and their preparations for war, he concluded that he must surpass the

                     strides toward prosperity. For the Sicilian Greeks were at peace, and the land

                     Festival of Liberation and hold games of distinction on the day on which they
                     had overthrown the tyrant and liberated their native city; and they also voted
                     to sacrifice to the gods, in connection with the games, four hundred and fifty

                     did not see fit to allow to share in this dignity, either because they judged
                     them to be unworthy or because they were suspicious lest men who had been
                     brought up in the way of tyranny and had served in war under a monarch might
                     attempt a revolution. And that is what actually happened. For Gelon had

                     Romans elected as consuls Quintus Fabius and Titus Quinctius Capitolinus.
                     During this year, in Asia the Persian generals who had passed over to Cilicia
                     made ready three hundred ships, which they fitted out fully for warfare, and
                     then with their land force they advanced overland through Syria and Phoenicia;
                     and with the fleet accompanying the army along the coast, they arrived at

                     course, they avoided any frontal encounters and strove to bring the war to an
                     end by the use of stratagems. Accordingly, since the Attic ships lay moored at
                     the island known as Prosopitis, they diverted by means of canals the river
                     which flowed around the island, and thus made the island a part of the

                     The Athenians, being now without allies and seeing that their ships had become
                     useless, set fire to them to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy,
                     and then themselves, undismayed at the alarming plight they were in, fell to

                     note of the exceptional courage of their foes and reasoning that they would be
                     unable to annihilate such men without sacrificing many myriads of their own,

                     Athenians, but since they had a considerable number of triremes and had built
                     some new ones, they engaged the Athenians in battle, but were defeated with the

                  <p> In my opinion this action was in no way inferior to any of the battles fought
                     by the Athenians in former times; for neither the victory at Marathon nor the
                     success over the Persians at Plataea nor the other renowned exploits of the
                     Athenians seem in any way to surpass the victory which Myronides won over the

                     gained with the aid of allies, but this struggle was won by the Athenians
                     single-handed in pitched battle, and they were pitted against the bravest
                     warriors to be found among the Greeks.</p>

               <div

                  <p>For in staunchness in the face of perils and in the fierce contests of war the
                     Boeotians are generally believed to be surpassed by no other people; at any
                     rate, sometime after this the Thebans at Leuctra and Mantineia, when they
                     unaided confronted all the Lacedaemonians and their allies, won for themselves
                     the highest reputation for courage, and contrary to expectation became the
                     leading nation of all Greece.</p>

                  <p> And yet, although the battle of Myronides has become famous, none of our
                     historians has described either the way it was fought or the disposition of the
                     troops engaged in it. Myronides, then, after defeating the Boeotians in a
                     remarkable battle, came to rival the reputations of the most renowned
                     commanders before his time, namely, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon.</p>

                  <p> Myronides after this victory took Tanagra by siege, levelled its walls, and
                     then he passed through all Boeotia, breaking it up and destroying it, and
                     dividing the booty among his soldiers he loaded them all down with spoil in
                     abundance. </p>

                  <p> The Boeotians, exasperated by the wasting of their land, sprang to arms as a
                     nation and when they had taken the field constituted a great army. A battle
                     took place at Oenophyta in Boeotia, and since both sides withstood the stress
                     of the conflict with stout hearts, they spent the day in fighting; but after a
                     severe struggle the Athenians put the Boeotians to flight and Myronides became
                     master of all the cities of Boeotia with the exception of Thebes.</p>

                     are known as Opuntian. These he overpowered at the first attack, and taking
                     hostages from them he then entered Parnasia.</p>

                  <p>In like manner as he had done with the Locrians, he also subdued the Phocians,
                     and after taking hostages he marched into Thessaly, finding fault with the
                     Thessalians for their act of treachery and ordering them to receive back their
                     exiles; and when the Pharsalians would not open their gates to him, he laid
                     siege to the city.</p>

                     for a long time against the siege, for the purpose he gave up his designs
                     regarding Thessaly and returned to Athens. Thus Myronides, who had performed
                     great deeds in a short space of time, won among his fellow citizens the renown
                     which was so widely acclaimed. </p>

                     promised that by taking eleven thousand hoplites aboard the triremes he would
                     with them lay waste Laconia and dim the fame of the Spartans.</p>

                     secretly a larger number of hoplites, had recourse to the following cunning
                     subterfuge. The citizens thought that he would enrol for the force the young
                     men in the prime of youth and most vigorous in body; but Tolmides, determined
                     to take with him in the campaign not merely the stipulated one thousand,
                     approached every young man of exceptional hardihood and told him that he was
                     going to enrol him; it would be better, however, he added, for him to go as a
                     volunteer than be thought to have been compelled to serve under compulsion by
                     enrolment.</p>

                  <p>When by this scheme he had persuaded more than three thousand to enrol

                     then enrolled the thousand he had been promised from all who were left. </p>

                     Methonê in Laconia, he took the place; and when the Lacedaemonians came to
                     defend it, he withdraw, and cruising along the coast to Gytheium, which was a
                     seaport of the Lacedaemonians, he seized it, burned the city and also the
                     dockyards of the Lacedaemonians, and ravaged its territory.</p>

                     then sailed across to the opposite mainland and put in at Naupactus. This city
                     he likewise seized at the first assault and in it he settled the prominent

                     and the Messenians they had allowed to depart from Ithomê under a truce, as we
                     have said, but of the Helots they had punished those who were responsible for
                     the revolt and had enslaved the rest. </p>

                     proceeded to make of them a personal bodyguard ready for an attempt to set up a
                     tyranny. Not after this, when it was evident that he was grasping after supreme

                     And in the confusion which arose throughout the city the most respectable
                     citizens, who had organized themselves, seized the revolutionists and put them
                     to death along with Tyndarides. And since this sort of thing kept happening
                     time and again and there were men whose hearts were set on a tyranny, the
                     people were led to imitate the Athenians and to establish a law very similar to

                     taking no part in public affairs, but consistently remained in private life
                     because of their fear of the law, attending to their personal fortunes and

                     cultivating cleverness in oratory, and, in a word, many were exchanging the
                     ancient and sober way of life for the ignoble pursuits; wealth was increasing

                     upon the walls to take the city, and when, besides, the Lacedaemonians sent aid
                     to the besieged, he withdrew from Sicyon; then he sailed to Acarnania, where he
                     overran the territory of Oeniadae, amassed much booty, and then sailed away
                     from Acarnania.</p>

                     sailed at first to the island known as Aethaleia and ravaged it, but he
                     secretly accepted a bribe of money from the Tyrrhenians and sailed back to

                     Tyrrhenians. He overran the coast of Tyrrhenia and then passed over to Cyrnus,
                     which was held at those times by the Tyrrhenians, and after sacking many places

                     federation; and being an energetic man, he was always grasping after
                     innovations, and so he gathered a large army from the Sicilian League and
                     removed the city of Menae, which was his native state, and planted it in the
                     plain. Also near the sacred precinct of the Palici, as they are called, he
                     founded an important city, which he named Palicê after the gods just mentioned.

                     astonishing than this, the water neither pours over nor recedes, but has a

                     Postumius and Marcus Horatius. During this year Ducetius, who held the
                     leadership of the Siceli, seized the city of Aetna, having treacherously slain
                     its leader, and then he moved with an army into the territory of the
                     Acragantini and laid siege to Motyum, which was held by a garrison of
                     Acragantini; and when the Acragantini and the Syracusans came to the aid of the
                     city, he joined battle with them, was successful, and drove them both out of

                     guilty of treason and put him to death. With the beginning of summer they

                     with difficulty the Syracusans overpowered and routed the Siceli, slaying many
                     of them as they fled. Of those who survived the battle the larger number found
                     safety in the strongholds of the Siceli, but a few chose to share the hopes of

                     won the victory, they now camped together. As for Ducetius, now that he had
                     been completely crushed by his defeat and that some of his soldiers were
                     deserting and others plotting against him, he had come to the depths of

                     Syracuse. And while it was still night he entered the market-place of the
                     Syracusans, and seating himself at the altars he became a suppliant of the
                     city, placing both his person and the land which he controlled at the

                     appropriate penalty; but the more fairminded of the elder citizens came forward
                     and declared it as their opinion that they should spare the suppliant and show
                     due regard for Fortune and the wrath of the gods. The people should consider,
                     they continued, not what punishment Ducetius deserved, but what action was
                     proper for the Syracusans; for to slay the victim of Fortune was not fitting,
                     but to maintain reverence for the gods as well as to spare the suppliant was an
                     act worthy of the magnanimity of the people.</p>

                     sent him off to Corinth, ordering him to spend his life in that city and also
                     giving him sufficient means for this his support. </p>

                     their own resources and without the aid of Lacedaemonians or Peloponnesians,
                     they overcame great Persian armaments both on land and on sea, and humbled the
                     famed leadership of the Persians to such an extent that they forced them by the
                     terms of a treaty to liberate all the cities of Asia.</p>

                     campaign of the Athenians against Cyprus and continue as far as the war which

                  <p> When Euthydemus was archon at Athens, the Romans elected as consuls Lucius
                     Quinctius Cincinnatus and Marcus Fabius Vibulanus. In this year the Athenians,
                     who had been at war with the Persians on behalf of the Egyptians and had lost
                     all their ships at the island which is known as Prosopitis, after a short time
                     resolved to make war again upon the Persians on behalf of the Greeks in Asia
                     Minor. And fitting out a fleet of two hundred triremes, they chose Cimon, the
                     son of Miltiades, to be general and commanded him to sail to Cyprus to make war
                     on the Persians.</p>

                  <p>And Cimon, taking the fleet which had been furnished with excellent crews and
                     abundant supplies, sailed to Cyprus. At that time the generals of the Persian
                     armaments were Artabazus and Megabyzus. Artabazus held the supreme command and
                     was tarrying in Cyprus with three hundred triremes, and Megabyzus was encamped
                     in Cilicia with the land forces, which numbered three hundred thousand men.</p>

                  <p>Cimon, when he arrived in Cyprus and was master of the sea, reduced by siege
                     Citium and Marium, treating the conquered in humane fashion. But after this,
                     when triremes from Cilicia and Phoenicia bore down upon the island, Cimon,
                     putting out to sea against them and forcing battle upon them, sank many of the
                     ships, captured one hundred together with their crews, and pursued the
                     remainder as far as Phoenicia.</p>

                     sailing up and disembarking the soldiers, joined battle, in the course of which
                     Anaxicrates, the other general, who had fought brilliantly, ended his life
                     heroically; but the rest were victorious in the battle and after slaying many
                     returned to the ships. After this the Athenians sailed back again to Cyprus. </p>

                     Valerius Lactuca and Spurius Verginius Tricostus. In this year Cimon, the
                     general of the Athenians, being master of the sea, subdued the cities of
                     Cyprus. And since a large Persian garrison was there in Salamis and the city
                     was filled with missiles and arms of every description, and of grain and
                     supplies of every other kind, he decided that it would be to his advantage to

                     being unable to come to the aid of the Salaminians, because the Athenians were
                     masters of the sea, and their having left their allies in the lurch would cause
                     them to be despised, and that, in a word, the entire war would be decided if
                     all Cyprus were reduced by arms. And that in which what actually happened. </p>

                     Greeks. Consequently Artabazus and Megabyzus sent ambassadors to Athens to
                     discuss a settlement. The Athenians were favourable and dispatched ambassadors
                     plenipotentiary, the leader of whom was Callias the son of Hipponicus; and so
                     the Athenians and their allies concluded with the Persians a treaty of peace,
                     the principal terms of which run as follows: All the Greek cities are to live
                     under laws of their own making; the satraps of the Persians are not to come
                     nearer to the sea than a three days' journey and no Persian warship is to sail
                     inside of Phaselis or the Cyanean Rocks; and if these terms are observed by the
                     king and his generals, the Athenians are not to send troops into the territory
                     over which the king is ruler. </p>

                     noteworthy terms of peace. And it so happened that Cimon died of an illness

                     Irritated at this the Athenians sent soldiers into the territory of the
                     Megarians, plundering their properties and seizing much booty. And when the
                     Megarians issued from their city to defend their territory, a battle ensued in

                     others were taken alive. The result of a disaster of such magnitude was that

                     perished; and they plundered the city of Sybaris and laid it entirely
                     waste.</p>

                     Sybarites under the leadership of Lampon and Xenocritus; they further sent word
                     to the several cities of the Peloponnesus, offering a share in the colony to

                     appears, were assigning the most important offices to themselves and the lower
                     ones to the citizens who had been enrolled later; their wives they also thought

                     the gods, and the wives of the later citizens should take second place to them;
                     furthermore, the land lying near the city they were portioning out in

                     themselves the colonization of the city. Since the countryside was extensive
                     and rich, they sent for colonists in large numbers from Greece, and to these

                     remaining four, constituted from any other peoples, the Ionian, the Athenian,
                     the Euboean, and the Islander. They also chose for their lawgiver the best man

                     to bear their great disgrace, voluntarily removed themselves from life. When
                     this took place, every man who had made a practice of false accusation was

                  <p>Charondas also wrote a unique law on evil association, which had been
                     overlooked by all other lawgivers. He took it for granted that the characters
                     of good men are in some cases perverted to evil by reason of their found and
                     intimacy with bad persons, and that badness, like a pestilent disease, sweeps
                     over the life of mankind and infects the souls of the most upright; for the
                     road to the worse slopes downward and so provides an easier way to take; and
                     this is the reason why many men of fairly good character, ensnared by deceptive
                     pleasures, get stranded upon very bad habits. Wishing, therefore, to remove
                     this source of corruption, the lawgiver forbade the indulgence in friendship
                     and intimacy with unprincipled persons, provided actions at law against evil
                     association, and by means of severe penalties diverted from their course those
                     who were about to err in this manner. </p>

                  <p>Charondas also wrote another law which is far superior to the one just
                     mentioned and had also been overlooked by lawgivers before his time. He framed
                     the law that all the sons of citizens should learn to read and write, the city
                     providing the salaries of the teachers; for he assumed that men of no means and
                     unable to provide the fees from their own resources would be cut off from the
                     noblest pursuits. </p>

                  <p> In fact the lawgiver rated reading and writing above every other kind of
                     learning, and with right good reason; for it is by means of them that most of
                     the affairs of life and such as are most useful are concluded, like votes,
                     letters, covenants, laws, and all other things which make the greatest

                     the living and that men widely separated in space hold converse through written
                     communication with those who are at the furthest distance from them, as if they
                     were at their side; and in the case of covenants in time of war between states
                     or kings the firmest guarantee that such agreements will abide is provided by
                     the unmistakable character of writing. Indeed, speaking generally, it is
                     writing alone which preserves the cleverest sayings of men of wisdom and the
                     oracles of the gods, as well as philosophy and all knowledge, and is constantly
                     handing them down to succeeding generations for the ages to come.</p>

                     Charondas, believing as he did that the illiterate were being deprived of
                     certain great advantages, by his legislation corrected this wrong and judged

                     outstanding in this law, but when it is explored deeply it is found to be

                  <p> Charondas also wrote a law against men who had left their post in war or had
                     refused to take up arms at all in defence of their fatherland. Other lawmakers
                     had made death the punishment of such men, but Charondas ordered that they
                     should sit for three days in the market-place dressed in women's clothes.</p>

                  <p>And this law is not only more humane than those of other peoples but it also
                     imperceptibly, by the severity of the disgrace it inflicts, diverts others of
                     like mind from cowardice; for it is better to die than to experience such a
                     gross indignity in one's fatherland. Moreover, he did not do away with the
                     guilty men but preserved them for the state against the needs of wartime,
                     believing that they would make amends, by reason of the punishment caused by
                     that disgrace, and would be eager to wipe out their former shame by bolder
                     deeds of bravery. </p>

                  <p>The lawgiver also preserved the laws he made by means of their severity. That
                     is, he commanded that under every circumstance obedience should be rendered to
                     the law even if it had been altogether wrongly conceived; but he allowed any
                     law to be corrected, if it needed correction.</p>

                  <p>For he took the position that although it was right enough that a man should be
                     overruled by a lawgiver, to be overruled by one in private station was quite
                     preposterous, even if that serves the general interest. And it was especially
                     by this means that he prevented men who present in jury-courts the pretences
                     and cunning devices of those who have violated the laws in place of the literal
                     terms of the laws from destroying by inventive sophistries their supremacy.</p>

                     before the jurors who were passing on the punishment of men who had violated
                     the law, he said, "You must save either the law or the man." </p>

                  <p> But the most amazing legislation of Charondas, we are told, was that which
                     related to revision of the laws. Observing that in most states the multitude of
                     men who kept endeavouring to revise the laws led continually to the vitiation
                     of the previously existing body of the laws and incite the masses to civil
                     strife, he wrote a law which was peculiar and altogether unique.</p>

               <div
                  n="2">
                  <p>He commanded, namely, that the man who proposed to revise any law should put
                     his neck in a noose at the time he made his proposal of a revision, and remain
                     in that position until the people had reached a decision on the revision of the
                     law, and if the Assembly approved the revised law, the introducer was to be
                     freed of the noose, but if the proposal of revision did not carry, the noose
                     was to be drawn and the man die on the spot.</p>

               <div

                  <p>Such being the legislation relating to revision, fear restrained subsequent
                     lawmakers and not a man dared to utter a word about revising laws; and in all
                     subsequent time history records but three men who proposed revision among the
                     Thurians, and these appeared because circumstances arose which rendered
                     proposals of revision imperative. </p>

               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p>Thus, there was a law that if a man put out the eye of another, he should have
                     his own eye put out, and man with but one eye, having had that eye put out and
                     thus lost his entire sight, claimed that the offender, by the loss in requital
                     of but one eye, had paid a less penalty; for, he maintained, if a man who had
                     blinded a fellow citizen paid only the penalty fixed by the law, he would not
                     have suffered the same loss; it would be just, therefore, that the man who had
                     destroyed the entire sight of a man with but one ye should have both his eyes
                     put out, if he were to receive a like punishment.</p>

                  <p>Consequently the man with one eye, taking the matter strongly to heart, made
                     bold to raise in the Assembly the case of the loss he had suffered, at the same
                     time both lamenting bitterly over his personal misfortune to his fellow
                     citizens and suggesting to the commons that they revise the law; and in the
                     end, putting his neck in a noose, he won his proposal, set at naught the
                     existing law, and had the revision approved, and he escaped the death by the

                     years and had a wife who was younger than he and had left him, proposed to the
                     Thurians that they revise the law by the added provision that the wife who
                     leaves a husband may marry whomever she chooses, provided the man is not

                     marriage to an heiress and that likewise an heiress be assigned in marriage to
                     her nearest relative, who was required to marry her or, if she were poor, to

                     turned to the people for aid, explaining to them with tears how helpless and
                     scorned she was; and she went on to outline the revision of the law whereby, in
                     place of the payment of five hundred drachmas, it should specify that the next
                     of kin be required to marry the heiress who had been assigned to him. The
                     people took pity on her and voted for the revision of the law, and thus the
                     orphan escaped the peril which threatened her from the noose, while the nearest
                     of kin, who was wealthy, was compelled to take to wife a penniless heiress

                  <p> It remains for us to speak of the death of Charondas, in connection with which
                     a peculiar and unexpected thing happened to him. He had set out to the country
                     carrying a dagger because of the robbers, and on his return the Assembly was in
                     session and the commons in an uproar, whereupon he approached it because he was
                     curious about the matter in dispute.</p>

               <div

                  <p>But he had made a law that no man should enter the Assembly carrying a weapon,
                     and since he had forgotten he was carrying the dagger at his side, he provided
                     certain of his enemies with an occasion to bring an accusation against him. And
                     when one of them said, "You have annulled your own law," he replied, "Not so,
                     by Zeus, I will uphold it," and drawing the dagger he slew himself. Some
                     historians, however, attribute this act to Diocles, the lawgiver of the
                     Syracusans. </p>

                  <p>But now that we have discoursed at sufficient length upon Charondas the
                     lawmaker, we wish to speak briefly also of the lawmaker Zaleucus, since the two
                     men not only followed similar principles of life but were also natives of
                     neighbouring cities. </p>

               <div
                  n="1">
                  <p> Now Zaleucus was by birth a Locrian of Italy, a man of noble family, admired
                     for his education, and a pupil of the philosopher Pythagoras. Having been
                     accorded high favour in his native city, he was chosen lawmaker and committed
                     to writing a thorough novel system of law, making his beginning, first of all,
                     with the gods of the heavens.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="2">
                  <p>For at the outset in the introduction to his legislation as a whole he declared
                     it to be necessary that the inhabitants of the city should first of all assume
                     as an article of their creed that gods exist, and that, as their minds survey
                     the heavens and its orderly scheme and arrangement, they should judge that
                     these creations are not the result of Chance or the work of men's hands; that
                     they should revere the gods as the cause of all that is noble and good in the
                     life of mankind; and that they should keep the soul pure from every kind of
                     evil, in the belief that the gods take no pleasure in either the sacrifices or
                     costly gifts of the wicked but in the just and honourable practices of good
                     men.</p>

               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p>And after inviting the citizens in this introduction to reverence and justice,
                     he appended the further command that they should consider no one of their
                     fellow citizens as an enemy with whom there can be no reconciliation, but that
                     the quarrel be entered into with the thought that they will again come to
                     agreement and friendship; and that the one who acts otherwise should be
                     considered by his fellow citizens to be savage and untamed of soul. Also the
                     magistrates were urged by him not to be wilful or arrogant, and not to render
                     judgement out of enmity or friendship. And among his several ordinances a
                     number were added of his own devising, which showed exceptionally great wisdom.

                  <p> To cite examples, whereas everywhere else wayward wives were required to pay
                     fines, Zaleucus stopped their licentious behaviour by a cunningly devised
                     punishment. That is, he made the following laws: a free-born woman may not be
                     accompanied by more than one female slave, unless she is drunk; she may not
                     leave the city during the night, unless she is planning to commit adultery; she
                     may not wear gold jewelry or a garment with a purple border, unless she is a
                     courtesan; and a husband may not wear a gold-studded ring or a cloak of
                     Milesian fashion unless he is bent upon prostitution or adultery.</p>

                  <p> Consequently, by the elimination, with its shameful implications, of the
                     penalties he easily turned men aside from harmful luxury and wanton living; for
                     no man wished to incur the sneers of his fellow citizens by acknowledging the
                     disgraceful licentiousness.</p>

                     acted as ambassadors between both parties to reach an agreement and begged them

                     among the magistrates of the state and should act as guardians of the freedom

                     came down to them from their ancestors, were lords, one might say, of the
                     state. It was furthermore stipulated in the agreement that when tribunes had
                     served their year of office they should see that an equal number of tribunes
                     were appointed in their place, and that if they failed to do this they should
                     be burned alive; also, in case the tribunes could not agree among themselves,
                     the will of the interceding tribune must not be prevented. Such, then, we find,

                     Pissuthnes, the Persian satrap. Pissuthnes gave them seven hundred soldiers,

                     upon for an accounting he fell ill, since he was unable to render the statement
                     of the monies with which he had been entrusted.</p>

                  <p>While he was worried over the matter, Alcibiades, his nephew, who was an orphan
                     and was being reared at the home of Pericles, though still a lad showed him a
                     way out of making an explanation of the use of the money. Seeing how his uncle
                     was troubled he asked him the cause of his worry. And when Pericles said, "I am
                     asked for the explanation of the use of the money and I am seeking some means
                     whereby I may be able to render an accounting of it to the citizens,"
                     Alcibiades replied, "You should be seeking some means not how to render but how
                     not to render an accounting."</p>

                  <p>Consequently Pericles, accepting the reply of the boy, kept pondering in what
                     way he could embroil the Athenians in a great war; for that would be the best
                     way, he thought, because of the disturbance and distractions and fears which
                     would the city, for him to escape giving an exact accounting of the money.
                     Bearing upon this expedient an incident happened to him by mere chance for the

                     assistants of Pheidias, who had been prevailed upon by Pericles' enemies, took
                     seats as suppliants at the altars of the gods; and when they were called upon
                     to explain their surprising action, they claimed that they would show that
                     Pheidias had possession of a large amount of the sacred funds, with the

                     the sophist Anaxagoras, who was Pericles' teacher, of impiety against the gods;
                     and they involved Pericles in their accusations and malicious charges, since

                     peace they keep bringing false accusations against the very same men because
                     they have nothing to do and are envious, came to the conclusion that it would
                     be to his own advantage to embroil the state in a great war, in order that the
                     city, in its need of the ability and skill in generalship of Pericles, should
                     pay no attention to the accusations being lodged against him and would have

                     Lacedaemonians, being won over by the Megarians, in the most open manner
                     dispatched ambassadors in accordance with the decision of the Council of the

                     Lacedaemonians, contrary to their own interests, would be the first step toward

                     superiority of its naval strength, and then the large sum of money which had
                     been removed from Delos to Athens and which had in fact been gathered from the

                     embellishment was so constructed as to be removable; and he showed that all
                     these, if dire need befell them, they could borrow from the gods and return to
                     them again when peace came, and that also by reason of the long peace the

                     garrisons and metics amounted to more than seventeen thousand, and the triremes

                     as Ephorus has recorded them. And when the leading states had become embroiled
                     in war in this fashion, the Lacedaemonians, sitting in council with the
                     Peloponnesians, voted to make war upon the Athenians, and dispatching
                     ambassadors to the king of the Persians, urged him to ally himself with them,
                     while they also treated by means of ambassadors with their allies in Sicily and

                     commence the conflict. For in Boeotia the city of the Plataeans was an
                     independent state and had an alliance with the Athenians.</p>

                     and sent them against the Peloponnesus. This force, by ravaging a large extent
                     of the Peloponnesian territory along the sea and capturing some fortresses,
                     struck terror into the Lacedaemonians; consequently they speedily recalled

                     won, had the daring to attack the ships of the enemy, although they far
                     outnumbered his; and some of them he sank, though losing ships of his own, so
                     that the victory he won was equivocal. After this, when the Athenians had
                     dispatched twenty triremes, the Lacedaemonians sailed off in fear to Corinth,

                     decided to seize the Peiraeus. He had received information that no ships in the
                     harbour had been put into the water for duty and no soldiers had been detailed
                     to guard the port; for the Athenians, as he learned, had become negligent about
                     guarding it because they by no means expected any enemy would have the audacity

                     wisdom he greatly increased his dominion, equitably governing his subjects,
                     playing the part of a brave soldier in battle and of a skilful general, and
                     furthermore giving close attention to his revenues. In the end he attained to
                     such power that he ruled over more extensive territory than had any who had

                     thirteen days for the journey. Ruling as he did over a territory so extensive

                     that the discussion of it may be clear to our readers. </p>
                  <p> Now Sitalces, since he had entered into a treaty of friendship with the
                     Athenians, agreed to support them in their war in Thrace; and consequently,
                     since he desired, with the help of the Athenians, to subdue the Chalcidians, he
                     made ready a very considerable army.</p>

                     Macedonians, he decided to bring back Amyntas, the son of Philip, and place him
                     upon the Macedonian throne. It was for these two reasons, therefore, as we have
                     described them, that he was forced to raise an imposing army. When all his
                     preparations for the campaign had been made, he led forth the whole army,
                     marched through Thrace, and invaded Macedonia.</p>

                     their most powerful strongholds, in which they remained inactive.</p>

                     one paid any attention to them, they forthwith made an assault on the first
                     stronghold and took it by storm.</p>

                     took counsel together and united in raising a considerable army; for they were
                     apprehensive lest the Thracians with all their myriads of soldiers should

                     Servius Cornelius Cossus. This year in Sicily the Leontines, who were colonists

                     by the Syracusans. And being hard-pressed in the war and in danger of having
                     their city taken by storm because of the superior power of the Syracusans, they
                     dispatched ambassadors to Athens asking the Athenian people to send them

                     rhetoric and so far excelled all other men in the instruction offered by

                     novelty of his speech he filled the Athenians, who are by nature clever and
                     fond of dialectic, with wonder.</p>

                     balanced clauses or similar endings, and the like, all of which at that time
                     was enthusiastically received because the advice was exotic, but is now looked

                     Gorgias, they voted to send an allied force to the Leontines, offering as their
                     excuse the need and request of their kinsmen, whereas in fact they were eager

                     powerful armaments, but also had taken over a great sum of ready money, since
                     they had transferred from Delos to Athens the funds of the confederacy of the
                     Greeks, which amounted to more than ten thousand talents; they also enjoyed the
                     services of great commanders who had stood the test of actual leadership; and
                     by means of all these assets it was their hope not only to defeat the
                     Lacedaemonians but also, after they had won the supremacy over all Greece, to
                     lay hands on Sicily. </p>

                     Charoeades. These sailed to Rhegium, where they added to their force twenty
                     ships from the Rhegians and the other Chalcidian colonists. Making Rhegium

                     were allies of the Syracusans, and after this they sailed to Locri, where they
                     captured five ships of the Locrians, and then laid siege to the stronghold of

                     commanders were Eurymedon and Sophocles. When all the triremes were gathered
                     into one place, a fleet of considerable strength had been fitted out,

                     sailed back home, and the Syracusans, granting the Leontines the right of
                     citizenship, made them all Syracusans and their city a stronghold of the

                     history seeks to ascertain the cause of the malignancy of this disease, it is

                  <p>As a result of heavy rains in the previous winter the ground had become soaked
                     with water, and many low-lying regions, having received a vast amount of water,
                     turned into shallow pools and held stagnant water, very much as marshy regions
                     do; and when these waters became warm in the summer and grew putrid, thick foul
                     vapours were formed, which, rising up in fumes, corrupted the surrounding air,
                     the very thing which may be seen taking place in marshy grounds which are by

                  <p>Contributing also to the disease was the bad character of the food available;
                     for the crops which were raised that year were altogether watery and their
                     natural quality was corrupted. And a third cause of the disease proved to be
                     the failure of the etesian winds to blow, by with normally most of the heat in
                     summer is cooled; and when the heat intensified and the air grew fiery, the

                     accompanied by fever, the cause of which was the excessive heat. And this was
                     the reason why most of the sick threw themselves into the cisterns and springs

                  <p>The Athenians, however, because the disease was so severe, ascribed the causes
                     of their misfortune to the deity. Consequently, acting upon the command of a
                     certain oracle, they purified the island of Delos, which was sacred to Apollo
                     and had been defiled, as men thought, by the burial there of the dead.</p>

                     passed a law that neither birth nor burial should be allowed on Delos. And they
                     also celebrated the festival assembly, the Delia, which had been held in former

                     Trachis, should assume the care of it. And the Lacedaemonians, both because of
                     their kinship and because Heracles, their ancestor, in ancient times had made
                     his home in Trachis, decided to make it a great city.</p>

                     they made Trachis a city of ten thousand inhabitants, and after portioning out

                     became almost uninhabited.</p>

                  <p>Demosthenes then believed that he should take Ambracia by storm, hoping that he
                     would have an easy conquest because the city had none to defend it. But the
                     Acarnanians, fearing lest, if the Athenians became masters of the city, they
                     should be harder neighbours to deal with than the Ambraciotes, refused to
                     follow him.</p>

                  <p>And since they were thus in disagreement, the Acarnanians came to terms with
                     the Ambraciotes and concluded with them a peace of one hundred years, while
                     Demosthenes, being left in the lurch by the Acarnanians, sailed back with his
                     twenty ships to Athens. The Ambraciotes, who had experienced a great disaster,
                     sent for a garrison of Lacedaemonians, since they stood in fear of the
                     Athenians. </p>

                  <p> Demosthenes now led an expedition against Pylos, intending to fortify this
                     stronghold as a threat to the Peloponnesus; for it is an exceptionally strong
                     place, situated in Messenia and four hundred stades distant from Sparta. Since
                     he had at the time both many ships and an adequate number of soldiers, in
                     twenty days he threw a wall about Pylos. The Lacedaemonians, when they learned
                     that Pylos had been fortified, gathered together a large force, both infantry

                     forty-five fully equipped triremes but also marched with an army of twelve
                     thousand soldiers; for they considered it to be a disgraceful thing that men
                     who were not brave enough to defend Attica while it was being ravaged should
                     fortify and hold a fortress in the Peloponnesus.</p>

                     undergo any and every danger and to take Pylos by storm, the Lacedaemonians
                     stationed the ships with their prows facing the entrance to the harbour in
                     order that they might use them for blocking the enemy's attempt to enter, and
                     assaulting the walls with the infantry in successive waves and displaying all
                     possible rivalry, they put up contests of amazing valour.</p>

                     Athenians in getting control of the island before them, since its situation was

                     would be disgraceful, he cried, for Spartans to be unsparing of their lives as
                     they fought for victory, and yet to spare their vessels and to endure the sight

                     on the island were in danger of death from starvation. Consequently the
                     Lacedaemonians, fearing for the men left on the island, sent an embassy to
                     Athens to discuss the ending of the war. When no agreement was being reached,
                     they asked for an exchange of men, the Athenians to get back and equal number
                     of their soldiers now held prisoner; but not even to this would the Athenians
                     agree. Whereupon the ambassadors spoke out frankly in Athens, that by their
                     unwillingness to effect an exchange of prisoners the Athenians acknowledged
                     that Lacedaemonians were better men than they.</p>

                     turned over to them the garrisoning of Pylos; for they believed that the

                     garrison, Tantalus the Spartan, he took captive and carried off to Athens. And
                     the Athenians fettered Tantalus and kept him under guard together with the

                     exiles on the other hand. And while representatives were exchanging opinions

                     Athenians within the walls. When the betrayal became known throughout the city
                     and while the multitude were divided according to party, some being in favour
                     of fighting on the side of the Athenians and others of aiding the
                     Lacedaemonians, a certain man, acting on his own initiative, made the
                     proclamation that any who so wished could take up arms on the side of the

                     long walls abandoned them and sought safety in Nisaea, as it is called, which
                     is the sea-port of the Megarians.</p>

                     promised that after passing upon their claims they would set them free; and

                     Brasidas had been joined by a thousand Helots and troops had been levied among

                     utterly destroyed by Thracians at Drabescus, and two years later the Athenians

                  <p>Since the city had been the object of many a battle, Brasidas was eager to
                     master it. Consequently he set out against it with a strong force, and pitching
                     his camp near the bridge, he first of all seized the suburb of the city and
                     then on the next day, having struck terror into the Amphipolitans, he received
                     the formal surrender of the city on the condition that anyone who so wished
                     could take his property and leave the city. </p>

                  <p>Immediately after this Brasidas brought over to his side a number of the
                     neighbouring cities, the most important of which were Oesymê and Galepsus, both
                     colonies of the Thasians, and also Myrcinus, a small Edonian city. He also set
                     about building a number of triremes on the Strymon River and summoned soldiers
                     from both Lacedaemon and the rest of the allies.</p>

                     young men who possessed no arms, and he gathered supplies of missiles and grain
                     and everything else. And when all his preparations had been made, he set out
                     from Amphipolis with his army and came to Actê, as it is called, where he
                     pitched his camp. In this area there were five cities, of which some were
                     Greek, being colonies from Andros, and the others had a populace of barbarians
                     of Bisaltic origin, which were bilingual.</p>

                     men were ready to betray the city, Brasidas was by night admitted by them and
                     got Toronê in his power without a fight. </p>

                     Certain Boeotians, who were restive under the form of government which obtained
                     at the time and were eager to establish democracies in the cities, discussed
                     their policy with the Athenian generals, Hippocrates and Demosthenes, and

                     informed of the betrayal he withdrew without accomplishing anything;
                     Hippocrates led the popular levy of the Athenians against Delium, seized the
                     place, and threw a wall about it before the approach of the Boeotians. The town

                     right wing, the Orchomenians on the left, and the centre of the line was made
                     up of the other Boeotians; the first line of the whole army was formed of what
                     they called "charioteers and footmen," a select group of three hundred. The

                     in excess of five hundred, the Athenian many times that number. However, if
                     night had not intervened, most of the Athenians would have perished, for it

                     territory and burning its farm-buildings they returned home. The
                     Lacedaemonians, being incensed at the lawless acts committed against the

                     pitched battle was imminent, the generals conducted negotiations with each
                     other and agreed upon a cessation of hostilities for four months.</p>

                     Consequently the Argives hurled stones at their commanders and began to menace
                     them with death; only reluctantly and after much supplication their lives were

                     advancing into Arcadia, they settled down to the siege of the city and made

                     allies and moved on Mantineia, believing that, once Mantineia was attacked in

                     the picked troops of the Argives, one thousand in number, who had received
                     excellent training in warfare, were the first to put to flight their opponents

                     and held out firmly against the perils he encountered; and he would have slain
                     all the Argives — for he was resolved to fulfil the promises he had made to his
                     fellow citizens and wipe out, by a great deed, his former ill repute — but he
                     was not allowed to consummate that purpose. For Pharax the Spartan, who was one
                     of the advisers of Agis and enjoyed the highest reputation in Sparta, directed
                     him to leave a way of escape for the picked men and not, by hazarding the issue
                     against men who had given up all hope of life, to learn what valour is when

                     allowed to pass through in the manner described, made their way to safety, and
                     the Lacedaemonians, having won the victory in a great battle, erected a trophy

                  <p> Since the Egestaeans had been humbled and were not strong enough of themselves
                     to offer battle, they at first tried to induce the Acragantini and the
                     Syracusans to enter into an alliance with them. Failing in this, they sent
                     ambassadors to Carthage to beseech its aid. And when the Carthaginians would
                     not listen to them, they looked about for some alliance overseas; and in this,

                     and their territory, those of them who were living in exile got together and
                     decided once more to take the Athenians, who were their kinsmen, as allies.</p>

                     Athenians to come to the aid of their cities, which were victims of ill
                     treatment, and promising to assist the Athenians in establishing order in the

                     a large sum of money for the war and also to fight as an ally against the
                     Syracusans, the Athenians voted to send some of their foremost men and to

                     they were unable to secure their supremacy over the Greeks, how could they hope
                     to subdue the greatest island in the inhabited world? even the Carthaginians,
                     he added, who possessed a most extensive empire and had waged war many times to
                     gain Sicily, had not been able to subdue the island, and the Athenians, whose
                     military power was far less than that of the Carthaginians, could not possibly

                     This year the Athenians, pursuant to their vote of the war against the
                     Syracusans, got ready the ships, collected the money, and proceeded with great
                     zeal to make every preparation for the campaign. They elected three generals,
                     Alcibiades, Nicias, and Lamachus, and gave them full powers over all matters

                     were mutilated. At this the people, believing that the deed had not been by

                     overthrow of the democracy, were incensed at the sacrilege and undertook a

                     the first day of the new moon and that one of them was Alcibiades. When he was
                     questioned by the Council and asked how he could recognize the faces at night,
                     he replied that he had seen them by the light of the moon. Since, then, the man
                     had convicted himself of lying, no credence was given to his story, and of

                     had agreed together to destroy the democracy in Argos, but they had all been
                     put to death by the citizens.</p>

                  <p>Accordingly the people, having given credence to the accusations and having had
                     their feelings deeply aroused by their demagogues, dispatched their ship, the
                     Salaminia, to Sicily with orders for Alcibiades to return with all speed to
                     face trial. When the ship arrived at Catanê and Alcibiades learned of the
                     decision of the people from the ambassadors, he took the others who had been
                     accused together with him aboard his own trireme and sailed away in company
                     with the Salaminia.</p>

                     the deed of impiety or because he was alarmed at the seriousness of the danger
                     which threatened him, made his escape together with the other accused men and
                     got away. The ambassadors who had come on the Salaminia at first set up a hunt
                     for Alcibiades, but when they could not find him, they sailed back to Athens
                     and reported to the people what had taken place.</p>

                     death. And Alcibiades made his way across from Italy to the Peloponnesus, where
                     he took refuge in Sparta and spurred on the Lacedaemonians to attack the

                     learning that the fleet under Demosthenes would arrive within a few days,
                     decided to run no more risks before that force should join them, whereas the
                     Syracusans, on the contrary, wishing to reach a final decision before the
                     arrival of Demosthenes and his army, kept sailing out every day against the
                     ships of the Athenians and continuing the fight.</p>

                     ships shorter and lower, the Syracusans followed his advice and for that reason
                     enjoyed great advantage in the fighting which followed.</p>

                     reason it followed that, when they rammed, they damaged only the parts of a
                     ship that extended above the water, so that the enemy suffered no great damage;
                     whereas the ships of the Syracusans, built as they were with the structure
                     about the prow strong and low, would often, as they delivered their ramming
                     blows, sink with one shock the triremes of the Athenians. </p>

                     and by sea, but to no effect, since the Athenians made no move; but when some
                     of the captains of the triremes, being no longer able to endure the scorn of
                     the Syracusans, put out against the enemy in the Great Harbour. A sea-battle
                     commenced in which all the triremes joined. Now though the Athenians had
                     fast-sailing triremes</p>

                     skill of their pilots, yet their superiority in these respects brought them no
                     return since the sea-battle was in a narrow area; and the Syracusans, engaging
                     at close quarters and giving the enemy no opportunity to turn about to ram, not
                     only cast spears at the soldiers on the decks, but also, by hurling stones,
                     forced them to leave the prows, and in many cases simply by ramming a ship that
                     met them and then boarding the enemy vessel they made it a land-battle on the
                     ship's deck.</p>

                     because of their victory over the enemy both by land and by sea, Eurymedon and
                     Demosthenes arrived, having sailed there from Athens with a great force and
                     gathered on the way allied troops from the Thurians and Messapians. They
                     brought more than eighty triremes and five thousand soldiers, excluding the
                     crews; and they also conveyed on merchant vessels arms and money as well as
                     siege machines and every other kind of equipment. As a result the hopes of the
                     Syracusans were dashed again, since they believed that they could not now
                     readily find the means to bring themselves up to equality with the enemy. </p>

                  <p>Demosthenes persuaded his fellow commanders to assault Epipolae, for it was
                     impossible by any other means to wall off the city, and taking ten thousand
                     hoplites and as many more light-armed troops, he attacked the Syracusans by
                     night. Since the assault had not been expected, they overpowered some forts,
                     and breaking into the fortifications of Epipolê threw down a part of the wall.

                     Hermocrates also came to the aid with the picked troops, the Athenians were
                     forced out and, it being night, because of their unfamiliarity with the region
                     were scattered some to one place and others to another.</p>

                     wave of pestilence had struck the camp because the region round about it was
                     marshy, counselled together how they should deal with the situation.</p>

               <div
                  n="2">
                  <p> Demosthenes thought that they should sail back to Athens with all speed,
                     stating that to risk their lives against the Lacedaemonians in defence of their
                     fatherland was preferable to settling down on Sicily and accomplishing nothing
                     worth while; but Nicias said that they ought not to abandon the siege in so
                     disgraceful a fashion, while they were well supplied with triremes, soldiers,
                     and funds; furthermore, he added, if they should make peace with the Syracusans
                     without the approval of the Athenian people and sail back to their country,
                     peril would attend them from the men who make it their practice to bring false
                     charges against their generals.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p>Of the participants in the council some agreed with Demosthenes on putting to
                     sea, but others expressed the same opinion as Nicias; and so they came to no
                     clear decision and took no action.</p>

                  <p> And since help came to the Syracusans from the Siceli, Selinuntians, and
                     Geloans, as well as from the Himeraeans and Camarinaeans, the Syracusans were
                     the more emboldened, but the Athenians became apprehensive. Also, when the
                     epidemic greatly increased, many of the soldiers were dying and all regretted
                     that they had not set out upon their return voyage long since.</p>

                  <p>Consequently, since the multitude was in an uproar and all the others were
                     eager to take to the ships, Nicias found himself compelled to yield on the
                     matter of their returning home. When the generals were agreed, the soldiers
                     began gathering together their equipment, loading the triremes, and raising the
                     yard-arms; and the generals issued orders to the multitude that at the signal
                     not a man in the camp should be late, for he who lagged would be left
                     behind.</p>

                     a superstitiously devout man but also cautious because of the epidemic in the
                     camp, summoned the soothsayers. And when they declared that the departure must
                     be postponed for the customary three days, Demosthenes and the others were also
                     compelled, out of respect for the deity, to accede. </p>

                     out their ground forces attacked the enemy both by land and by sea.</p>

                  <p>The Athenians, having manned eighty-six triremes, assigned to Eurymedon, the

                     general of the Syracusans, Agatharchus; on the other wing Euthydemus had been
                     stationed and opposite to him was Sicanus commanding the Syracusans; and in
                     command of the centre of the line were Menander for the Athenians and Pythes

                     endeavoured to outfit the opposing wing; but when he had become detached from
                     his line, the Syracusans turned to face him and he was cut off and forced into

                     ships gave way which were nearest to those which had been destroyed, but later,
                     as the Syracusans pressed forward and pushed the fight boldly because of the

                  <p>So long as the men who entrusted their lives to our good faith have suffered no
                     irremediable punishment, all men will justly censure the Athenian people; but

                     has been broken with the captives, they will shift their accusation against us.
                     For in truth, if it can be said of any other people, the prestige of the city
                     of the Athenians deserves our reverence, and we may well return to them our
                     gratitude for the benefactions they have bestowed upon man.</p>

                     their exclusive use, they made available to all. They it was who discovered
                     laws, by the application of which the manner of men's living has advanced from
                     the savage and unjust existence to a civilized and just society. It was they
                     who first, by sparing the lives of any who sought refuge with them, contrived
                     to cause the laws on suppliants to prevail among all men, and since they were
                     the authors of these laws, we should not deprive them of their protection. So

                     initiating his policy in the interest of the Syracusans, was the only man to
                     oppose the expedition against Sicily, and who has continually looked after the

                     should escape his deserved punishment both from us and from the Athenians,
                     whereas he who has proved himself by common consent the most humane among

                     to Athenians, have been robbed of their nearest kinsmen, and they are bound to

                     of the majority, but on the contrary it came to pass, such was the superiority
                     of the combatants, that the whole situation changed for the following reasons.

                  <p>Alcibiades, who was in exile from Athens, had for a time fought on the side of
                     the Lacedaemonians and had rendered them great assistance in the war; for he
                     was a most able orator and far the outstanding citizen in daring, and, besides,
                     he was in high birth and wealth first among the Athenians.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p>Now since Alcibiades was eager to be allowed to return to his native city, he
                     contrived every device whereby he could do the Athenians some good turn, and in
                     particular at the crucial moments when the Athenians seemed doomed to utter
                     defeat.</p>

                  <p>Accordingly, since he was on friendly terms with Pharnabazus, the satrap of
                     Darius, and saw that he was on the point of sending three hundred ships to the
                     support of the Lacedaemonians, he persuaded him to give up the undertaking; for
                     he showed him that it would not be to the advantage of the King to make the
                     Lacedaemonians too powerful. That would not, he said, help the Persians, and so
                     a better policy would be to maintain a neutral attitude toward the combatants
                     so long as they were equally matched, in order that they might continue their
                     quarrel as long as possible.</p>

                  <p>Thereupon Pharnabazus, believing that Alcibiades was giving him good advice,
                     sent the fleet back to Phoenicia. Now on that occasion Alcibiades deprived the
                     Lacedaemonians of so great an allied force; and some time later, when he had
                     been allowed to return to Athens and been given command of a military force, he
                     defeated the Lacedaemonians in many battles and completely restored again the
                     sunken fortunes of the Athenians.</p>

                     Cornelius, Gaius Valerius, and Caeso Fabius. At this time the Athenians
                     dissolved the oligarchy of the Four hundred and formed the constitution of the

                     the only person to advise the recall from exile of Alcibiades, through whom the
                     Athenians recovered themselves, and since he was the author of many other

                     triremes had arrived from Phoenicia, he was buoyed up in his hopes, believing

                     up the hopes he had placed in Pharnabazus and by himself, after equipping both
                     the ships bought from the Peloponnesus and those supplied by his allies from
                     abroad, he dispatched Dorieus with thirteen ships to Rhodes, since he had

                     the Athenian generals decided to sail on to Lesbos and there to gather triremes
                     from their allies, in order that it should not turn out that the enemy

                     haste for the Hellespont and arrived on the second day at Sigeium. When the
                     Athenians learned that the fleet had sailed by them, they did not wait for all
                     the triremes of their allies, but after only three had been added to their
                     number they set out in pursuit of the Lacedaemonians.</p>

               <div

                  <p>The Lacedaemonians, seeing the enemy rehearsing for the battle, did likewise,
                     spending five days in proving their ships and exercising their rowers; then
                     they drew up the fleet for the battle, its strength being eighty-eight ships.
                     Now the Lacedaemonians stationed their ships on the Asian side of the channel,
                     while the Athenians lined up against them on the European side, being fewer in
                     number but of superior training.</p>

                  <p>The Lacedaemonians put on their right wing the Syracusans, whose leader was
                     Hermocrates, and the Peloponnesians themselves formed the whole left wing with
                     Mindarus in command. For the Athenians Thrasyllus was stationed on the right
                     wing and Thrasybulus on the left. At the outset both sides strove stubbornly
                     for position in order that they might not have the current against them.</p>

                  <p> Consequently they kept sailing around each other for a long time, endeavouring
                     to block off the straits and struggling for an advantageous position; for the
                     battle took place between Abydus and Sestus and it so happened that the current
                     was of no little hindrance where the strait was narrow. However, the pilots of
                     the Athenian fleet, being far superior in experience, contributed greatly to
                     the victory. </p>

                  <p> For although the Peloponnesians had the advantage in the number of their ships
                     and the valour of their marines, the skill of the Athenian pilots rendered the
                     superiority of their opponents of no effect. For whenever the Peloponnesians,
                     with their ships in a body, would charge swiftly forward to ram, the pilots
                     would manoeuvre their own ships so skilfully that their opponents were unable
                     to strike them at any other spot but could only meet them bows on, ram against
                     ram.</p>

               <div

                  <p>Consequently Mindarus, seeing that the force of the rams was proving
                     ineffective, gave orders for his ships to come to grips in small groups, or one
                     at a time. But not by this manoeuvre either, as it turned out, was the skill of
                     the Athenian pilots rendered ineffective; on the contrary, cleverly avoiding
                     the on-coming rams of the ships, they struck them on the side and damaged
                     many.</p>

               <div

                  <p>And such a spirit of rivalry pervaded both forces that they would not confine
                     the struggle to ramming tactics, but tangling ship with ship fought it out with
                     the marines. Although they were hindered by the strength of the current from
                     achieving great success, they continued the struggle for a considerable time,
                     neither side being able to gain the victory.</p>

                  <p>While the fighting was thus equally balanced, there appeared beyond a cape
                     twenty-five ships which had been dispatched to the Athenians from their allies.
                     The Peloponnesians thereupon in alarm turned in flight toward Abydus, the
                     Athenians clinging to them and pursuing them the more vigorously. </p>

                  <p>Such was the end of the battle; and the Athenians captured eight ships of the
                     Chians, five of the Corinthians, two of the Ambraciotes, and one each of the
                     Syracusans, Pellenians, and Leucadians, while they themselves lost five ships,
                     all of them, as it happened, having been sunk.</p>

                     made his way to Cyzicus with the entire fleet. For before the sea-battle this
                     city had revolted to Pharnabazus, the general of Darius, and to Clearchus, the
                     Lacedaemonian commander. Finding the city unfortified the Athenians easily
                     achieved their end, and after exacting money of the Cyziceni they sailed off to

                     by his own efforts to achieve some advantage for his country. Hence, seeing
                     that the Selinuntians were not satisfied with the cession of the territory in
                     dispute, he dispatched ambassadors together with the Aegestaeans to the
                     Syracusans, referring to them the decision of the dispute; and though
                     ostensibly he pretended to be seeking that justice be done, in fact he believed
                     that, after the Selinuntians refused to agree to arbitration, the Syracusans

                     for reinforcements of both soldiers and ships; for he had in mind, while the
                     fleet was being made ready, to lay siege with the army together with

                  <p>The people of Chalcis and almost all the rest of the inhabitants of Euboea had
                     revolted from the Athenians and were therefore highly apprehensive lest, living
                     as they did on an island, they should be forced to surrender to the Athenians,
                     who were masters of the sea; and they therefore asked the Boeotians to join
                     with them in building a causeway across the Euripus and thereby joining Euboea
                     to Boeotia.</p>

                  <p>The Boeotians agreed to this, since it was to their special advantage that
                     Euboea should be an island to everybody else but a part of the mainland to
                     themselves. Consequently all the cities threw themselves vigorously into the
                     building of the causeway and vied with one another; for orders were issued not
                     only to the citizens to report en masse but to the foreigners dwelling among
                     them as well, so that by reason of the great number that came forward to the
                     work the proposed task was speedily completed.</p>

                     so happened that in former times also there had always been a current in that
                     place and that the sea frequently reversed its course, and at the time in
                     question the force of the current was far greater because the sea had been
                     confined into a very narrow channel; for passage was left for only a single
                     ship. High towers were also built on both ends and wooden bridges were thrown

                     bloodshed. For it would seem that the number of those who were slain by their

                     prevailed among them. For the foremost Corcyraeans, who desired the oligarchy,
                     favoured the cause of the Lacedaemonians, whereas the masses which favoured the
                     democracy were eager to ally themselves with the Athenians.</p>

                  <p>For the peoples who were struggling for leadership in Greece were devoted to
                     opposing principles; the Lacedaemonians, for example, made it their policy to
                     put the control of the government in the hands of the leading citizens of their
                     allied states, whereas the Athenians regularly established democracies in their

                     essayed a final decision of the struggle. When night brought an end to the

                     attack of Theramenes, but, after dividing the Peloponnesians, with half of them
                     he met the advancing enemy, while with the other half which he himself
                     commanded, first calling upon each soldier not to disgrace the fair name of
                     Sparta, and that too in a fight on land, he formed a line against the troops of
                     Alcibiades.</p>

                     the troops of Alcibiades as he battled nobly for his fatherland. When he had
                     fallen, both the Peloponnesians and all allies banded together and broke into

                     returned to the ships, and after they had taken the city they set up two
                     trophies for the two victories, one for the sea-battle at the island of
                     Polydorus, as it is called, and one for the land-battle where they forced the

                     selected from their most stalwart men one thousand hoplites and one hundred
                     horsemen, and in addition to these they dispatched thirty triremes to
                     Alcibiades, in order that, now that they dominated the sea, they might lay

                     of whom was Endius. When permission was given him, he took the floor and spoke
                     succinctly and in the terse fashion of Laconians, and for this reason I have

                     Laconians the war has brought many allies, from the Athenians it has taken away
                     as many as it has given to their enemies. For us the richest king to be found

                     citizens. And, what is the most important, even if we meet defeat in our
                     actions at sea, we still maintain without dispute the mastery on land — for a
                     Spartan foot-soldier does not even know what flight means — but you, if you are

                     is profiting from the war, but only that she is suffering less than the
                     Athenians. Only fools find satisfaction in sharing the misfortunes of their
                     enemies, when it is in their power to make no trial whatsoever of misfortune.
                     For the destruction of the enemy brings no joy that can balance the gift caused

                     the chief office, and in Rome Quintus Fabius and Gaius Furius held the
                     consulship. At this time Hannibal, the general of the Carthaginians, gathered
                     together both the mercenaries he had collected from Iberia and the soldiers he
                     had enrolled from Libya, manned sixty ships of war, and made ready some fifteen

                     Sicily on the promontory which lies opposite Libya and is called Lilybaeum;</p>

                     informed their fellow citizens of the presence of the enemy. The Selinuntians
                     at once dispatched their letter-carriers to the Syracusans, asking their

                     when a city was founded near it, the presence of the well occasioned the giving

                     thousand men. His ships he hauled up on land in the bay about Motyê, every one
                     of them, wishing to give the Syracusans the impression that he had not come to
                     make war upon them or to sail along the coast with his naval force against

                     And when he came to the Mazarus River, he took at the first assault the
                     trading-station situated by it, and when he arrived before the city, he divided
                     his army into two parts; then, after he had invested the city and put his

                     learning the facts about the siege, first stopped the war they were engaged in

                     continued the fighting in fresh condition. Finally, since the troops within the

                     with their allies were on the march to the aid of the Himeraeans and that
                     Hannibal was planning to man his triremes in Motyê with his choicest troops

                     not happen that the city should be taken by storm while its best troops were

                  <p>They decided, therefore, that their best course was to abandon the city, and
                     that they should embark half the populace on the triremes (for these would
                     convey them until they had got beyond Himeraean territory) and with the other
                     half keep guard until the triremes should return.</p>

                     was no other course they could take, the triremes were hastily loaded by night
                     with a mixed throng of women and children and of other inhabitants also, who

                     Himeraeans with children and wives set out with Diocles, since the triremes
                     could not carry the whole populace. </p>

                  <p> Those who had been left behind in Himera spent the night under arms on the

                     and launched repeated attacks, the remaining Himeraeans fought with no thought

                     before the blows of the siege-engines and the Iberians to pour in a body into
                     the city. Some of the barbarians thereupon would hold off the Himeraeans who
                     rushed up to bring aid, while others, gaining command of the walls, would help

                     Hannibal, after sacking the temples and dragging out the suppliants who had
                     fled to them for safety, set them afire, and the city he razed to the ground,
                     two hundred and forty years after its founding. Of the captives the women and
                     children he distributed among the army and kept them under guard, but the men
                     whom he took captive, some three thousand, he led to the spot where once his
                     grandfather Hamilcar had been slain by Gelon and after torturing them put them
                     all to death.</p>

                  <p>After this, breaking up his army, he sent the Sicilian allies back to their
                     countries, and accepting them also were the Campanians, who bitterly complained
                     to the Carthaginians that, though they had been the ones chiefly responsible
                     for the Carthaginian successes, the rewards they had received were not a fair

                     Sicily. And when he arrived at Carthage with much booty, the whole city came
                     out to meet him, paying him homage and honour as one who in a brief time had

                  <p> Hermocrates the Syracusan arrived in Sicily. This man, who had served as
                     general in the war against the Athenians and had been of great service to his
                     country, had acquired the greatest influence among the Syracusans, but
                     afterwards, when he had been sent as admiral in command of thirty-five triremes
                     to support the Lacedaemonians, he was overpowered by his political opponents
                     and, upon being condemned to exile, he handed over the fleet in the

                     money with which, after he had arrived at Messenê, he had five triremes built

                     make good his return to Syracuse; but when he failed in this design, he set out
                     through the middle of the island and seizing Selinus he built a wall about a
                     part of the city and called to him from all quarters the Selinuntians who were

                  <p>He also received many others into the place and thus gathered a force of six

                     territory of the inhabitants of Motyê and defeating in battle those who came
                     out from the city against him he slew many and pursued the rest within the wall
                     of the city. After this he ravaged the territory of the people of Panormus and
                     acquired countless booty, and when the inhabitants offered battle en masse
                     before the city he slew about five hundred of them and shut up the rest within

                     And among other things the majority of the Syracusans also repented of their
                     treatment of him, realizing that Hermocrates had been banished contrary to the

                     Hermocrates, on hearing of the talk about himself that was current in Syracuse,
                     laid careful plans regarding his return from exile, knowing that his political

                     soldiers with plunder but also themselves realized money from the booty, since

                     great danger, saved his own life by the use of money, and he is reputed to have

                     refuge in a body in the city.</p>

               <div

                  <p>After this Alcibiades sailed out into the Hellespont and to Chersonesus,
                     wishing to contract money, and Theramenes concluded an agreement with the
                     Chalcedonians whereby the Athenians received from them as much tribe as before.
                     Then leading his troops from there to Byzantium he laid siege to the city and
                     with great alacrity set about walling it off.</p>

                  <p>And Alcibiades, after collecting money, persuaded many of the Thracians to join
                     his army and he also took into it the inhabitants of Chersonesus en masse;
                     then, setting forth with his entire force, he first took Selybria by betrayal,
                     in which, after exacting from it much money, he left a garrison, and then
                     himself came speedily to Theramenes at Byzantium.</p>

                  <p>When the armaments had been united, the commanders began making the
                     preparations for a siege; for they were setting out to conquer a city of great
                     wealth which was crowded with defenders, since, not counting the Byzantines,
                     who were many, Clearchus, the Lacedaemonian harmost, had in the city many
                     Peloponnesians and mercenaries.</p>

                  <p>Consequently, though they kept launching assaults for some time, they continued
                     to inflict no notable damage on the defenders; but when the governor left the
                     city to visit Pharnabazus in order to get money, thereupon certain Byzantines,
                     hating the severity of his administration (for Clearchus was a harsh man),
                     agreed to deliver up the city to Alcibiades and his colleagues. </p>

                     their ships and withdrew the land army some distance; but when night came, they
                     turned back again and about the middle of the night drew near the city, and
                     they dispatched the triremes with orders to drag off the boats and to raise a
                     clamour as if the entire force were at that point, while they themselves,
                     holding the land army before the walls, watched for the signal which had been

                     Peloponnesians in the city and everyone who was unaware of the trickery rushed

                     undertakings had also come again to the city. Furthermore, just as the
                     Lacedaemonians enjoyed success while he was fighting on their side, so they

                     on both his successes and his return from exile. He in turn, after greeting the
                     crowds kindly, called a meeting of the Assembly, and offering a long defence of
                     his conduct he brought the masses into such a state of goodwill that all agreed

                     written his sentence and all the other acts passed against him; and they also
                     voted that the Eumolpidae should revoke the curse they had pronounced against

                     excel all others in skill as a general and who possessed a daring that was
                     ready to meet every situation. As soon as Lysander assumed the command he

                     gave greater aid than was required of them and that Lysander was quickly
                     supplied in startling fashion with all the equipment that is useful in war.

                     against him, he directed his course to Samos. </p>

                     sailing to Thasos with fifteen ships defeated in battle the troops who came out
                     from the city and slew about two hundred of them; then, having bottled them up
                     in a siege of the city, he forced them to receive back their exiles, that is
                     the men who favoured the Athenians, to accept a garrison, and to be allies of

                     engaged in an expedition with Alcibiades, he led his army on a moonless night

                     some twelve hundred cavalry, of whom the Boeotians furnished nine hundred and
                     the rest had been sent with him by Peloponnesians. As he drew near the city, he
                     came upon the outposts before they were aware of him, and easily dispersing

                     Since these promptly responded to the call, the circuit of the wall was manned

                     moment were at first dismayed, seeing as they did that approximately two-thirds
                     of the wall was surrounded by the enemy. After this, however, they sent out
                     their cavalry, who were about equal in number to the opposing cavalry, and when
                     the two bodies met in a cavalry-battle before the city, sharp fighting ensued
                     which lasted for some time. For the line of the infantry was some five stades
                     from the wall, but the cavalry which had engaged each other were fighting at
                     the very walls.</p>

                     inferior to the men they had once conquered, while the Athenians, since they
                     had as spectators of their valour the populace standing upon the walls and were
                     known every one to them, were ready to endure everything for the sake of

                     were at odds with him, sailed to Athens and accused Alcibiades in the Assembly
                     of favouring the Lacedaemonian cause and of forming ties of friendship with

                     wrongs he had committed against Cymê, but the Athenian people, viewing with
                     suspicion the boldness of the man, chose as the ten generals Conon, Lysias,
                     Diomedon, and Pericles, and in addition Erasinides, Aristocrates, Archestratus,
                     Protomachus, Thrasybulus, and Aristogenes. Of these they gave first place to

                     withdrew to Pactyê in Thrace, since, apart from the anger of the multitude, he
                     was afraid of the law-suits which had been brought against him.</p>

                     horses, involving the sum of eight talents. Diomedes, it appears, one of his
                     friends, had sent in his care a four-horse team to Olympia; and Alcibiades,
                     when entering it in the usual way, listed the horses as his own; and when he
                     was the victor in the four-horse race, Alcibiades took for himself the glory of
                     the victory and did not return the horses to the man who had entrusted them to
                     his care.</p>

                     collected the bones of the dead and putting them upon wagons which he had

                     turning out en masse paid honour to the burial procession. Diocles was exiled;

                     that the enemy's ships were bearing down on him, he decided that it would be
                     dangerous for him to join battle in that place with triremes double his in

                     drawing some of the enemy's triremes after him, to engage them off Mitylenê.
                     For by such tactics, he assumed, in case of victory he could turn about and
                     pursue and in case of defeat he could withdraw for safety to the harbour.</p>

                     near him. And the Lacedaemonians, as they approached, kept driving the ships

                     oars and were themselves separated a long distance from the others. Conon,
                     noticing this, when his ships were already near Mitylenê, raised from his
                     flagship a red banner, for this was a signal for the captains of the triremes.

                     pitched a camp, and then he set up a trophy for the sea-battle. And on the next

                     fall on them first. They decided, therefore, to gather not only their grain and
                     other crops but also all their possessions from the countryside within their
                     walls.</p>

                  <p>At this time, it so happened, both the city and the territory of the
                     Acragantini enjoyed great prosperity, which I think it would not be out of
                     place for me to describe. Their vineyards excelled in their great extent and
                     beauty and the greater part of their territory was planted in olive-trees from
                     which they gathered an abundant harvest and sold to Carthage;</p>

                     inhabitants of the territory belonging to Acragas took in exchange for their
                     products the wealth of Acragas and accused fortunes of unbelievable size. Of
                     this wealth there remain among them many evidences, which it will not foreign

                     Zeus, bear witness to the grand manner of the men of that day. Of the other
                     sacred buildings some have been burned and others completely destroyed because
                     of the many times the city has been taken in war, but the completion of the
                     temple of Zeus, which was ready to receive its roof, was prevented by the war;
                     and after the war, since the city had been completely destroyed, never in the
                     subsequent years did the Acragantini find themselves able to finish their

                     it is the largest temple in Sicily, it may not unreasonably be compared, so far
                     as magnitude of its substructure is concerned, with the temples outside of
                     Sicily; for even though, as it turned out, the design could not be carried out,

                     combines both these plans; for the columns were built in with the walls, the
                     part extending outside the temple being rounded and that within square; and the
                     circumference of the outer part of the column which extends from the wall is
                     twenty feet and the body of a man may be contained in the fluting, while that

                     beauty, and in the west The Capture of Troy, in which each one of the heroes

                     ingeniously contrived to produce a multitude of fish of every variety for their
                     public feastings, and with the fish swans spent their time and a vast multitude
                     of every other kind of bird, so that the pool was an object of great delight to

                  <p> Among the Acragantini of that time perhaps the richest man was Tellias, who
                     had in his mansion a considerable number of guest-chambers and used to station
                     servants before his gates with orders to invite every stranger to be his guest.
                     There were also many other Acragantini who did something of this kind, mingling
                     with others in an old-fashioned and friendly manner; consequently also

                     there were in it, he states, three hundred great casks hewn out of the very
                     rock, each of them with a capacity of one hundred amphoras, and beside them was
                     a wine-vat, plastered with stucco and with a capacity of one thousand amphoras,

                     Centoripa and came forward to speak before the Assembly, the multitude broke
                     into unseemly laughter as they saw how much he fell short of their expectation.
                     But he, interrupting them, said, "Don't be surprised, for it is the practice of
                     the Acragantini to send to famous cities their most handsome citizens, but to
                     insignificant and most paltry cities men of their sort." </p>

                     occurred, he says, but also of many other inhabitants of Acragas. Antisthenes
                     at any rate, who was called Rhodus, when celebrating the marriage of his
                     daughter, gave a party to all the citizens in the courtyards where they all
                     lived and more than eight hundred chariots followed the bride in the
                     procession; furthermore, not only the men on horseback from the city itself but
                     also many from neighbouring cities who had been invited to the wedding joined
                     to form the escort of the bride.</p>

                     lightning: the altars in all the temples and those in the courtyards throughout
                     the city he had piled high with wood, and to the shopkeepers he gave firewood
                     and brush with orders that when a fire was kindled on the acropolis they should

                     was filled with light, and the main streets through which the procession was to
                     pass could not contain the accompanying throng, all the inhabitants zealously
                     emulating the man's grand manner. For at that time the citizens of Acragas
                     numbered more than twenty thousand, and when resident aliens were included, not
                     less than two hundred thousand.</p>

                     of land, for a time he merely reproved his son; but when his son's cupidity
                     grew more intense, he said to him that he should not be doing his best to make
                     his neighbour poor but, on the contrary, to make him rich; for then the man
                     would long for more land, and when he would be unable to buy additional land

                     retrieve the defeat. For he remembered also how the Himeraeans had been utterly
                     destroyed for the same reason. However, when the barbarians were in flight to
                     their camp before Acragas, the soldiers in the city, seeing the defeat of the
                     Carthaginians, begged their generals to lead them out, saying that the

                     in a body, forced their way to the tent of Himilcar and demanded the rations

                     of the Greeks to be hopeless, were bought off for fifteen talents and went over

                     rise and so many myriads of human beings were gathered into one city, the grain

                     somewhere else, for our provisions have failed." Consequently the generals,
                     offering as their excuse that the time agreed upon for the campaign had

                     discovered that it was quite low, they perceived that they were compelled to
                     desert the city. At once, then, they issued orders that all should leave on the

                     necessity, because of their haste, of leaving behind as booty for the
                     barbarians the possessions on which they had based their happiness; for when
                     Fortune was robbing them of the comforts they enjoyed in their homes, they

                     relatives, everyone taking thought for his own safety, and those who were
                     already far advanced in years were abandoned because of the weakness of old
                     age; and many, reckoning even speculation from their native city to be the

                     away toward the territory of the Geloans were crowded with women and children

                     to take refuge with certain others in the temple of Athena, thinking that the
                     Carthaginians would refrain from acts of lawlessness against the gods, but when
                     he saw their impiety, he set fire to the temple and burned himself together

                     the gods impiety, from the enemy a vast store of plunder, and from himself,
                     most important of all, certain physical indignity.</p>

                     great skill, The most valuable pieces, accordingly, Himilcar sent to Carthage,
                     among which, as it turned out, was the bull of Phalaris, and the rest of the

                     on the charge of raising an uproar, Philistus, who later composed his History,
                     a man of great wealth, paid the fine and urged Dionysius to speak out whatever
                     he had had in his mind to say. And when Philistus went on to say that if they
                     wanted to fine Dionysius throughout the whole day he would provide the money
                     for him, from then on Dionysius, full of confidence, hand stirring up the
                     multitude, and throwing the assembly into confusion he accused the generals of
                     taking bribes to put the security of the Acragantini in jeopardy. And he also
                     denounced the rest of the most renowned citizens, presenting them as friends of
                     oligarchy.</p>

                  <p>Consequently he advised them to choose as generals not the most influential
                     citizens, but rather those who were the best disposed and most favourable to
                     the people; for the former, he maintained, ruling the citizens as they do in a
                     despotic manner, hold the many in contempt and consider the misfortunes of
                     their country their own source of income, whereas the more humble will do none
                     of such things, since they fear their own weakness. </p>

                  <p> Dionysius, by suiting every word of his harangue to the people to the
                     predilection of his hearers and his own personal design, stirred the anger of
                     the assembly to no small degree; for the people, which for some time past had
                     hated the generals for what they considered to be their bad conduct of the war
                     and at the moment were spurred on by what was being said to them, immediately
                     dismissed some of them from office and chose other generals, among whom was
                     also Dionysius, who enjoyed the reputation of having shown unusual bravery in
                     the battles against the Carthaginians and was admired of all the Syracusans.

                  <p>Having become elated, therefore, in his hopes, he tried every device to become
                     tyrant of his country. For example, after assuming office he neither
                     participated in the meetings of the generals nor associated with them in any
                     way; and while acting in this manner he spread the report that they were
                     carrying on negotiations with the enemy. For in this way he hoped that he could
                     most effectively strip them of their power and clothe himself alone with the
                     office of general. </p>

                     suspected what was taking place and in every gathering spoke disparagingly of
                     him, but the common crowd, being ignorant of his scheme, gave him their
                     approbation and declared that at long last teach had found a steadfast leader.

                     citizens in facing their own dangers, citizens who, although the enemy kept
                     promising them great rewards for their military co‑operation, chose rather to
                     die as wanderers on foreign soil than plan some hostile act against their

                     strife in the city, if at this time they were the recipients of this
                     benefaction, would fight with eagerness, showing in this way their appreciation
                     to their benefactors. After reciting many arguments for this proposal that bore
                     on the situation, he won the votes of the Syracusans to his view; for no one of
                     his colleagues in office dared oppose him in the matter both because of the
                     eagerness shown by multitude and because each observed that he himself would
                     gain only enmity, while Dionysius would heap a reward of gratitude from those
                     who had received kindness from him.</p>

                     establishment of a tyranny; for they would be happy to witness the murder of
                     their enemies, the confiscation of their property, and the restoration to
                     themselves of their possessions. And when finally the resolution regarding the
                     exiles was passed, these returned at once to their native land. </p>

                     troops, Dionysius got a favourable means of accomplishing his own purpose.
                     Having been dispatched with two thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry, he
                     arrived speedily at the city of the Geloans, which at that time was under the
                     eye of Dexippus, the Lacedaemonian, who had been put in charge by the
                     Syracusans.</p>

                     whereupon he put them to death and confiscated their possessions. With the
                     money thus gained he paid the guards of the city under the command of Dexippus
                     the wages which were owing them, while to his own troops who had come with him
                     from Syracuse he promised he would pay double the wages which the city had
                     determined. In this manner he won over to himself the loyalty not only of the
                     soldiers in Gela but also of those whom he had brought with him. He also gained
                     the approval of the populace of the Geloans, who believed him to be responsible
                     for their liberation; for in their envy of the most influential citizens they
                     stigmatized the superiority these men possessed as a despotism over

                  <p>Consequently they dispatched ambassadors who sang his praises in Syracuse and
                     reported decrees in which they honoured him with rich gifts. Dionysius also
                     undertook to persuade Dexippus to associate himself with his design, and when
                     Dexippus would not join with him, he was on the point of returning with his own

                     not to stand idly by while they suffered the same fate as the Acragantini.
                     Dionysius replied to them that he would return speedily with a larger force and
                     set forth from Gela with his own soldiers. </p>

                  <p> A play was being presented in Syracuse and Dionysius arrived in the city at
                     the time when the people were leaving the theatre. When the populace rushed in
                     throngs to him and were questioning him about the Carthaginians, they were
                     unaware, he said, that they had more dangerous enemies than their foreign foes
                     — the men within the city in charge of the public interests; these men the
                     citizens trusted while they held public festivals, but these very men, while
                     plundering the public funds, had let the soldiers go unpaid, and although the
                     enemy was making their preparations for the war on a scale which could not be
                     surpassed and were about to lead their forces upon Syracuse, the generals were
                     giving these matters no concern whatsoever.</p>

                  <p>The reason for such conduct, he continued, he had been aware of before, but now
                     he had got fuller information. For Himilcon had sent a herald to him,
                     ostensibly to treat about the captives, but in fact to urge him, now that
                     Himilcon had induced a large number of Dionysius' colleagues not to bother
                     themselves with what was taking place, at least to offer no opposition, since
                     he, Dionysius, did not choose to co‑operate with him.</p>

               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p>Consequently, Dionysius continued, he did not wish to serve longer as general,
                     but was present in Syracuse to lay down his office; for it was intolerable for
                     him, while the other generals were selling out their country, to be the only
                     one to fight together with the citizens and yet be at the same time destined to
                     be thought in after years to have shared in their betrayal. </p>

                     spread through the whole army, at the time every man departed to his home full
                     of anxiety. But on the following day, when an assembly had been convened in
                     which Dionysius won no small approval when he lodged many accusations against
                     the magistrates and stirred up the populace against the generals,</p>

                     and not to wait until the enemy were storming their walls; for the magnitude of
                     the war, they urged, made necessary such a general, through whose leadership
                     their cause could prosper; as for the traitors, their case would be debated in
                     another assembly, since it was foreign to the present situation; indeed at a
                     former time three hundred thousand Carthaginians had been conquered at Himera
                     when Gelon was general with supreme power.</p>

                  <p>And soon the multitude, as is their wont, swung to the worse decision and
                     Dionysius was appointed general with supreme power. And now, since the
                     situation corresponded to his desires, he proposed a decree that the pay of the
                     mercenaries be doubled; for they would all, he said, if this were done, be more
                     eager for the coming contest, and he urged them not to worry at all about the
                     funds, since it would be an easy task to raise them. </p>

                     for as their thoughts turned to their own state they could imagine the
                     tyrannical power which was to follow. Now these men, in their desire to insure
                     their freedom, had unwittingly established a despot over their country;</p>

                     part of the populace, kept seeking a means whereby he could ask for a guard for
                     his person, for if this were granted him he would easily establish himself in
                     the tyranny. At once, then, he issued orders that all men of military age up to
                     forty years should provide themselves rations for thirty days and report to him
                     under arms at Leontini. This city was at that time an outpost of the
                     Syracusans, being full of exiles and foreigners. For Dionysius hoped that he
                     would have these men on his side, desiring as they did a change of government,

                     uproar; and after doing this he took refuge on the acropolis, where he passed

                     populace to give him a guard of six hundred soldiers whomsoever he should
                     select. It is said that Dionysius did this in imitation of Peisistratus the

                     a guard at the hands of the citizens, by means of which he established the
                     tyranny. And at this time Dionysius, having deceived the multitude by a similar

                     arms, and buoyed them up with extravagant promises; the mercenaries also he won
                     to himself by calling them to him and conversing with them in friendly fashion.
                     He made changes also in the military posts, conferring their commands upon his
                     most faithful followers; and Dexippus the Lacedaemonian he dismissed to Greece,
                     for he was suspicious of this man lest he should seize a favourable opportunity

                     find its strongest support. While in Syracuse, however, he took up his quarters
                     in the naval station, having openly proclaimed himself tyrant. Although the
                     Syracusans were offended, they were compelled to keep quiet; for they were
                     unable to effect anything now, since not only was the city thronged with

                     Hermocrates' wife. This he did out of a desire to draw a distinguished house
                     into relationship with him in order to make firm the tyranny. After this he

                     victims foretell victory for you but death for me, I am none the less ready to
                     die. Accordingly, knowing that after the death of commanders forces are thrown

                     associated with himself on the right wing also Theramenes, giving him a
                     command. At the time Theramenes was on the campaign as a private citizen,

                     the large space occupied by the islands, he divided his force, and forming two

                     renowned. Consequently he was the first to drive at the ship of Lysias the
                     general, and shattering it at the first blow together with the triremes
                     accompanying it, he sank it; and as for the other ships, some he rammed and

                     in the gap and they could not withdraw it, Pericles threw an iron hand on the
                     ship of Callicratidas, and when it was fastened tight, the Athenians,
                     surrounding the ship, sprang upon it, and pouring over its crew put them all to

                     as he was struck from all directions. As soon as the defeat of the admiral

                     that the main body of the victors was turning against them, they were compelled
                     to take flight. Now of the Peloponnesians some found safety in Chios and some

                     that they should pick up the dead, since the Athenians are incensed at those

                     the dead. But this very thing turned out to be the principal cause of their
                     undoing.</p>

                     the trial, men who both were able orators and had many friends and, most
                     important of all, had been participants in the events relative to the battle,
                     they had them, on the contrary, as adversaries and bitter accusers.</p>

                  <p>For when the letters were read before the people, the multitude was at once
                     angered at Theramenes and his associates, but after these had presented their
                     defence, it turned out that their anger was directed again on the generals.</p>

                  <p>Consequently the people served notice on them of their trial and ordered them

                     responsibility, while they decreed that the others should report to Athens with
                     all speed. Of the generals Aristogenes and Protomachus, fearing the wrath of
                     the populace, sought safety in flight, but Thrasyllus and Calliades and,
                     besides, Lysias and Pericles and Aristocrates sailed home to Athens with most
                     of their ships, hoping that they would have their crews, which were numerous,
                     to aid them in the trial.</p>

                     defence they unitedly greeted with clamour and would not allow to speak. And
                     not the least damaging to the generals were the relatives of the dead, who
                     appeared in the assembly in mourning garments and begged the people to punish
                     those who had allowed men who had gladly died on behalf of their country to go

                     we made for the victory, inasmuch as Fortune has prevented our paying them,

                     had aroused great compassion and tears; for that the man who was about to meet

                     same name and at the same hour on which the Carthaginians seized the Apollo at
                     Gela, it came to pass that the god was honoured by the Greeks with the greatest

                     still in the city. Now these troops, as the day was beginning to break, set out
                     to join Dionysius, and the Carthaginians, on learning what had taken place,
                     moved their quarters into the city and plundered what had been left of the

                     admitted of no delay, some gathered together silver and gold and whatever could
                     be easily carried, while others fled with only their parents and infant
                     children, paying no attention to valuables; and some, who were aged or
                     suffering from illness, were left behind because they had no relatives or
                     friends, since the Carthaginians were expected of the arrive almost

                     the savagery of the Carthaginians. For among them there was no sparing their
                     captives, but they were without compassion for the victims of Fortune of whom
                     they would crucify some and upon others inflict unbearable outrages.</p>

                     teemed with women and children and the rabble in general. And when the soldiers
                     witnessed these conditions, they were not only enraged against Dionysius but
                     also filled with pity at the lot of the unfortunate victims;</p>

                     pell-mell along the road in a manner improper for their age, since the stress
                     of the moment had done away with the dignity and respect which are shown before
                     strangers. Similarly they sympathized also with the elderly, as they watched
                     them being forced to push onward beyond their strength while trying to keep up
                     with those in the prime of life. </p>

                  <p> It was for these reasons that the hatred against Dionysius was flaring up,

                     dread of the Carthaginians to be lord or remaining cities of Sicily without
                     risk.</p>

                  <p>For they reckoned up his delay in bringing aid; the fact that none of his
                     mercenaries had fallen; that he had retreated without reason, since he had
                     suffered no serious reverse; and, most important of all, that not a single one
                     of the Carthaginians had pursued them. Consequently, for those who before this
                     were eager to seize an opportunity to revolt, all things, as if by the
                     foreknowledge of the gods, were working toward the overthrow of the tyrannical

                     hope that they might be able to slay the tyrant along the road; but when they
                     saw that the mercenaries were not deserting him, they rode off with one accord

                     was filled with silver and gold and all other costly things, and seizing his
                     wife left her so ill-used as to ensure the tyrant's keeping his anger fiercely
                     alive, acting as they did in the belief that the vengeance they wreaked on
                     Dionysius' wife would be the surest guarantee of their holding by each other in
                     their attack upon him.</p>

                     most trustworthy of his cavalry and infantry, with whom he pressed toward the
                     city without checking speed; for he reasoned that he could overcome the cavalry
                     by no other means than by speedy action, and he acted accordingly. For if he
                     should make his arrival even more of a surprise than theirs had been, he had
                     hope that he would easily carry out his design; and that is what happened.</p>

                     their design, they said that he had pretended that in leaving Gela he was
                     giving the slip to the Carthaginians whereas the truth in fact was that he had
                     given the slip to the Syracusans. </p>

                     hundred infantry, and finding the gate closed, he piled upon it reeds brought
                     from the marshes such as the Syracusans are accustomed to use to bind their
                     stucco. While the gates were being burned down, he gathered to his troops the

                     they heard what had happened, without waiting for the main body, and although
                     they were very few in number, rushed forth at once to aid in the resistance.
                     They were gathered in the market-place, and there they were surrounded by the
                     mercenaries and shot down to a man.</p>

                     some of them he killed and others he banished from the city. The main body of
                     the cavalry which was left fled from the city and occupied Aetnê, as it is now

                     dispatched a herald to Syracuse urging the vanquished to make up their
                     differences. Dionysius was glad to comply and they concluded peace on the
                     following terms: To the Carthaginians shall belong, together with their
                     original colonists, the Elymi and Sicani; the inhabitants of Selinus, Acragas,
                     and Himera as well as those of Gela and Camarina may dwell in their cities,

                     inhabitants of Leontini and Messenê and the Siceli shall all live under laws of
                     their own making, and the Syracusans shall be subject to Dionysius; and
                     whatever captives and ships are held shall be returned to those who lost them.

                     pestilence continued to rage no less in Libya also and great numbers both of

                     manifest that it cannot even be denied, none the less deeply resent it when
                     they are the objects of censure and endeavour to make a reply to the
                     accusation. Consequently all men should take every possible care not to commit
                     any evil deed, and those especially who aspire to leadership or have been

                     gained some kind of pre-eminence, cherish the hope that, if he commits great
                     crimes, he will for all time escape notice and go uncensured. For even if
                     during his own lifetime he eludes the sentence of rebuke, let him expect that

                     those things that follow after death do not concern us, as certain philosophers
                     keep chanting, nevertheless the life which has preceded death becomes far worse

                     districts of Sicily. Philistus, however, who composed his history after these
                     events, declared in opposition to Polyxenus that it was not fitting to dash
                     from the tyranny on a galloping horse but to be cast out, dragged by the
                     leg.</p>

                     by the troops from Phrygia and Lydia and about a thousand of the cavalry, under
                     the command of Aridaeus.</p>

                     missiles they began to run at great speed. Clearchus the Lacedaemonian had
                     given orders for them to do this, for by not running from a great distance he
                     had in mind to keep the fighters fresh in body for the fray, while if they
                     advanced on the run when at close quarters, this, it was thought, would cause

                  <p> Clearchus called together both the generals and commanders and took counsel

                     name, who was a Zacynthian. They were introduced to the gathering and spoke as
                     follows: "King Artaxerxes says: Since I have defeated and slain Cyrus, do you
                     surrender your arms, come to my doors, and seek how you may appease me and gain
                     some favour."</p>

                     when he was guarding the Pass of Thermopylae, and Xerxes sent messengers
                     ordering him to lay down his arms.</p>

                  <p>For Leonides at that time instructed the messengers to report to the King: "We
                     believe that if we become friends of Xerxes, we shall be better allies if we
                     keep our arms, and if we are forced to wage war against him, we shall fight the
                     better if we keep them."</p>

                  <p> When Clearchus had made a somewhat similar reply to the message, Proxenus the
                     Theban said, "As things now stand, we have lost practically everything else,
                     and all that is left to us is our valour and our arms. It is my opinion,
                     therefore, that if we guard our arms, our valour also will be useful to us, but
                     if we give them up, then not even our valour will be of any help to us."
                     Consequently he gave them this message to the King: "If you are plotting some
                     evil against us, with our arms we will fight against you for your own
                     possessions."</p>

                  <p>We are told that also Sophilus, one of the commanders, said, "I am surprised at
                     the words of the King; for if he believes that he is stronger than the Greeks,
                     let him come with his army and take our arms away from us; but if he wishes to
                     use persuasion, let him say what favour of equal worth he will grant us in

                     requires at once, while what will be given us in return he commands us to
                     request of him at a later time. In a word, if it is in ignorance of who are the
                     victors that he orders us to obey his command as though we had been defeated,
                     let him come with his numerous host and find out on whose side the victory
                     lies; but if, knowing well enough that we are the victors, he uses lying words,

                     from the battle. When the entire force had gathered in the same place, they
                     counselled together how they should make their way back to the sea and what

                     available with a hostile army on their heels. They resolved, therefore, to make
                     toward Paphlagonia, and set out in that direction with the army, proceeding at

                     deeds of courage in the battle and judged Tissaphernes seem to have been the
                     bravest of all. Consequently he honoured him with rich gifts, gave him his own
                     daughter in marriage, and henceforth continued to hold him as his most trusted
                     friend; and he also gave him the command which Cyrus had held over the

                     and come to terms with Aridaeus, for he believed that Aridaeus would betray the
                     Greeks to him in the course of the march. The King readily accepted this
                     suggestion and allowed him to select from his entire army as many of the best

                     to command; but after this, since no one disturbed them, they elected a number
                     of generals and put the supreme command in the hands of one, Cheirisophus the
                     Lacedaemonian.</p>

                  <p>The generals organized the army for the march on the route they thought best

                     Artaxerxes, who executed the others but spared Menon alone, since he alone,
                     because of a quarrel with his allies, was thought to be ready to betray the

                     recklessness of desperate men; and although he harassed them in places well
                     suited for that purpose, he was unable to do them any great harm, but he
                     followed them, causing slight difficulties, as far as the country of the people

                     with slings and in the use of enormous arrows, with which missiles they

                     The satrap here was Tiribazus, with whom they made a truce and passed through

                     At first, when the air was stirred, the snow began to fall in light quantities
                     from the heavens, so that the marchers experienced no trouble in their advance;

                     the storm increased in intensity, there came a great wind and heavy hail which
                     beat in gusts on their faces and forced the entire army to come to a halt; for
                     everyone, being unable to endure the hardship entailed in a further advance,

                     their bodies were completely chilled by the frost in the air. The hardships
                     they endured were so great that they got no sleep the entire night. Some
                     lighted fires and got some help from them, and some, whose bodies were invaded
                     by the frost, gave up all hope of succour, since practically all their fingers

                     defeated them in battle, slaying great numbers of them, seized their farms,

                     through the territory of the Scytini by a road across a plain, on which they
                     refreshed themselves for three days, enjoying all the necessities of life in

                     raised such a cry that the men in the rear, assuming that there was an attack

                     expedition. To the guide they gave as presents a silver bowl and a suit of
                     Persian raiment; and he, after pointing out to them the road to the Macronians,

                     seized a stronghold in Attica called Phylê. This was an outpost, which was not
                     only very strong but was also only one hundred stades distant from Athens, so
                     that it afforded them many advantages for attack.</p>

                     that it would be a terrible thing for them to stand idly by when Greek cities,

                     mentioned had advanced as far as the borders of Messenê, opposition broke out
                     among the soldiers due to a harangue delivered by the Messenian Laomedon;</p>

                     speedily to Rhegium. At the outset Dionysius had led out his army to the border
                     of the Syracusan territory, awaiting the attack of the enemy; but when he

                  <p> When Dionysius observed that some of the Greeks were deserting to the

                     concluded that so long as he was at peace with the Carthaginians many of his
                     subjects would be wanting to join their defection, whereas, if there were war,
                     all who had been enslaved by the Carthaginians would revolt to him. And he also

                     most powerful people of Europe.</p>

                     Greece as well as Carthaginian territory. For his purpose was to make weapons
                     in great numbers and every kind of missile, and also quadriremes and
                     quinqueremes, no ship of the latter size having yet been built at that

                     citizens, offering great bounties to any who created a supply of arms. As for
                     the armour, he distributed among them models of each kind, because he had
                     gathered his mercenaries from many nations;</p>

               <div

                  <p>for he was eager to have every one of his soldiers armed with the weapons of
                     his people, conceiving that by such armour his army would, for this very
                     reason, cause great consternation, and that in battle all of his soldiers would
                     fight to best effect in armour to which they were accustomed.</p>

                     it came to pass that rivalry rose high to manufacture the arms. For not only
                     was every space, such as the porticoes and back rooms of the temples as well as
                     the gymnasia and colonnades of the market place, crowded with workers, but the
                     making of great quantities of arms went on, apart from such public places, in
                     the most distinguished homes. </p>

                  <p> In fact the catapult was invented at this time in Syracuse, since the ablest
                     skilled workmen had been gathered from everywhere into one place. The high
                     wages as well as the numerous prizes offered the workmen who were judged to be
                     the best stimulated their zeal. And over and above these factors, Dionysius
                     circulated daily among the workers, conversed with them in kindly fashion, and
                     rewarded the most zealous with gifts and invited them to his table.</p>

                     great service. He also began the construction of quadriremes and quinqueremes,

                     Sicily was engaged on their construction; and when, on the other hand, he
                     visited the places where men were making arms and engines of war, he thought

                     Dionysius hired mercenaries. When the building of the ships and the making of
                     arms were completed, Dionysius turned his attention to the gathering of

                     since he made a point of gathering his mercenary force from many nations and

                     cities of Sicily with courtesy, eliciting their goodwill. He saw that the
                     Rhegians and Messenians who dwelt on the Strait had a strong army mobilized and
                     he feared that, when the Carthaginians crossed over to Sicily, they would join
                     the Carthaginians; for these cities would add no little weight to the side with
                     which they allied themselves for the war.</p>

                     borders, binding them to him by such a benefaction; and to the Rhegians he
                     dispatched ambassadors, urging them to form a connection by marriage and to
                     give him in marriage a maiden who was a citizen of theirs; and he promised that
                     he would win for them a large section of neighbouring territory and do all that
                     was in his power to add to the strength of their city.</p>

                     cavalry revolted, he was eager to beget children, in the belief that the
                     loyalty of his offspring would be the strongest safeguard of his tyrannical
                     power. Nevertheless, when an assembly of the people was held in Rhegium to
                     consider Dionysius' proposal, after much discussion the Rhegians voted not to

                     marriage connection, Dionysius sued for the hand of Doris, the daughter of

                     for he now renounced the oppressive aspect of his tyranny, and changing to a
                     course of equitable dealing, he ruled over his subjects in more humane fashion,

                  <p> After his marriages he let a few days pass and then called an assembly of the

                     every opportunity on the Greeks of Sicily in particular.</p>

                     plague which had broken out among them and had destroyed the larger part of the
                     inhabitants of Libya, but when they had recovered their strength, they would
                     not refrain from attacking the Sicilian Greeks, against whom they had been

                  <p>It was therefore preferable, he continued, to wage a decisive war upon them
                     while they were still weak than to wait and compete when they were strong. At
                     the same time he pointed out how terrible a thing it was to allow the Greek
                     cities to be enslaved by barbarians, and that these cities would the more
                     zealously join in the war, the more eagerly they desired to obtain their

                  <p>After speaking at length in support of his policy he speedily won the approval
                     of the Syracusans. Indeed they were no less eager than he for war, first of all
                     because of their hatred of the Carthaginians who were the cause of their being
                     compelled to take orders from the tyrant; secondly, because they hoped that
                     Dionysius would treat them in more humane fashion because of his fear of the
                     enemy and of an attack upon him by the citizens he had enslaved; but most of
                     all, because they hoped that once they had got weapons in their hand, they
                     could strike for their liberty, let Fortune but give them the opportunity. </p>

                     number of Carthaginians had their homes in Syracuse and rich possessions, and
                     many also of their merchants had vessels in the harbour loaded with goods, all
                     of which the Syracusans plundered.</p>

                     display of their hatred of the Phoenicians; for not only did they seize their
                     property as plunder, but they also laid hands on their persons and subjected
                     them to every kind of physical torture and outrage, remembering what they had
                     themselves suffered during the time of their captivity.</p>

                     more to transgress the law in their treatment of conquered peoples; for they
                     did not fail to realize, learning as they did by very deeds, that in war
                     Fortune is impartial to both combatants and in defeat both sides must suffer

                     Syracusans, had completed all his preparations for the war according to his
                     personal design, he sent a herald to Carthage, having given him a letter to the

                     the thought of war; for the plague had killed great numbers of them, and they

                     they did, came over to Dionysius. The inhabitants of Motyê, however, expecting
                     aid from the Carthaginians, were not dismayed at Dionysius' armament, but made
                     ready to withstand a siege; for they were not unaware that the Syracusans would
                     make Motyê the first city to sack, because it was most loyal to the
                     Carthaginians.</p>

                     to the prosperity of the inhabitants. It also had a narrow artificial causeway
                     extending to the shore of Sicily, which the Motyans breached at this time, in
                     order that the enemy should have no approach against them. </p>

                     himself set out with the infantry of his army against the cities that were
                     allies of the Carthaginians. Now the Sicani, fearing the great size of the
                     army, all went over to the Syracusans, and of the rest of the cities only five
                     remained loyal to the Carthaginians, these being Halicyae, Solûs, Aegesta,

                     Entella with strong forces and launched continuous attacks upon them, seeking
                     to get control of them by force. Such was the state of the affairs of

                     for he hoped that when this city had been reduced by siege, all the others
                     would forthwith surrender themselves to him. Accordingly, he at once put many
                     times more men on the task of filling up the strait between the city and the
                     coast, and, as the mole was extended, advanced his engines of war little by

                     for he assumed that if he appeared unexpectedly, he should easily seize the
                     vessels which were hauled up on land in the harbour, since he would be master
                     of the sea. Once he succeeded in this, he believed, he would not only relieve
                     the siege of Motyê but also transfer the war to the city of the Syracusans.</p>

                     at daybreak at Motyê. Since his appearance took the enemy by surprise, he
                     disabled some of the vessels anchored along the shore by ramming and others by
                     burning, for Dionysius was unable to come to their defence.</p>

                     the entrance of the harbour; but when he saw that the enemy was lying in wait
                     to attack as the ships left the harbour, he refused to risk launching his ships
                     within the harbour, since he realized that the narrow entrance compelled a few
                     ships to match themselves against an enemy many times more numerous.</p>

                  <p> Consequently, using the multitude of his soldiers, he hauled his vessels over
                     the land with no difficulty and launched them safely in the sea outside the
                     harbour. Himilcon attacked the first ships, but was held back by the multitude
                     of missiles; for Dionysius had manned the ships with a great number of archers
                     and slingers, and the Syracusans slew many of the enemy by using from the land
                     the catapults which shot sharp-pointed missiles. Indeed this weapon created
                     great dismay, because it was a new invention at this time. As a result,
                     Himilcon was unable to achieve his design and sailed away to Libya, believing
                     that a sea-battle would serve no end, since the enemy's ships were double his
                     in number. </p>

                     hammering the towers with his battering-rams, while with the catapults he kept
                     down the fighters on the battlements; and he also advanced against the walls

                     glory, they in the first place raised up men in crow's-nests resting on
                     yard-arms suspended from the highest possible masts, and these from their lofty
                     positions hurled lighted fire-brands and burning tow with pitch on the enemies'

                     them be surrendered to the lawless will of victors, who were thus wrought to a
                     pitch where they set no value on life; others, as they heard the laments of

                     they had used their Greek captives and the prospect of their suffering the same

                     of accommodating all his ships, which numbered more than six hundred, and

                     their own cavalry were at Syracuse — were fully convinced that nothing could
                     save them from capture. When contributed most to their despair was the fact

                     interpreted the utterance to their advantage, believing that the Carthaginians

                     of joining the ships on the Catanaean shore; for he was concerned lest, when
                     his forces were divided, the Sicilian Greeks should fight a battle with Magon
                     at sea.</p>

                  <p>And this is what actually took place. For Dionysius, when he realized that
                     Magon had a short sail, whereas the route of the land forces was toilsome and
                     long, hastened to Catanê with the object of attacking Magon by sea before the
                     arrival of Himilcon.</p>

                  <p>His hope was that his land forces lined up along the coast would embolden his
                     own troops while the enemy would be the more fearful, and, what was the most
                     important consideration, that if he should suffer a reverse of some kind, the
                     ships in distress would be able to take refuge in the camp of the land
                     forces.</p>

                  <p>With this purpose in mind, he dispatched Leptines with his whole fleet under
                     orders to engage with his ships in close order, and not to break his line lest
                     he be endangered by the great numbers of his opponents; for, including
                     merchantmen and oared vessels with brazen beaks, Magon had no less than five
                     hundred ships. </p>

                  <p> When the Carthaginians saw the shore thronged with infantry and the ships of
                     the Greeks bearing down on them, they were at once not a little alarmed and
                     began to make for the land; but later, when they realized the risk they ran of
                     destruction in giving battle at the same time both to the fleet and to the
                     infantry, they quickly changed their mind. Deciding, therefore, to face the
                     battle at sea, they drew up their ships and awaited the approach of the enemy.

                     leading ships of the Carthaginians, at the outset he sank no small number of
                     the opposing triremes; but when Magon's massed ships crowded about the thirty,
                     the forces of Leptines surpassed in valour, but the Carthaginians in

                     For they did not drive upon the opposing ships from a distance in order to ram
                     them, but the vessels were locked together and the fighting was hand to hand.
                     Some, as they leaped for the enemy's ships, fell into the sea, and others, who
                     succeeded in their attempt, continued the struggle on the opponents' ships.</p>

                     destroyed more than one hundred of their ships, and stationing their lighter

                     Carthaginians, but the loss of the Sicilian Greeks amounted to more than one

                     they would certainly be invested and forced to endure a laborious siege, they
                     urged Dionysius to seek an immediate encounter with Himilcon because of his
                     past victory; for, they said, perhaps their unexpected appearance would strike

                     hands of the barbarians in a similar manner. And so, believing that it was not
                     safe to strip the city of defenders, he set out for Syracuse.</p>

                     inhabitants of the city. For two hundred and fifty ships of war entered the
                     harbour, with oars flashing in order and richly decorated with the spoils of
                     war; then came the merchantmen, in excess of three thousand, laden with more
                     than five hundred . . . ; and the whole fleet numbered some two hundred
                     vessels. The result was that the harbour of the Syracusans, despite its great
                     size, was blocked up by the vessels and it was almost entirely concealed from
                     view by the sails.</p>

                     infantry and three thousand cavalry. The general of the armaments, Himilcon,
                     took up his quarters in the temple of Zeus and the rest of the multitude

                     sailed up to the harbours with a hundred of his finest ships in order to strike
                     terror into the inhabitants of the city and to force them to concede that they

                     commands of the Carthaginians, and if conquerors, to have in Dionysius a
                     harsher master than they would be. For even should the Carthaginians defeat us
                     in war, they would only impose a fixed tribute and would not prevent us from
                     governing the city in accordance with our ancient laws; but this man has
                     plundered our temples, has taken the property of private citizens together with
                     the lives of their owners, and pays a wage to servants to secure the
                     enslavement of their masters. Such horrors as attend the storming of cities are
                     perpetrated by him in time of peace, yet he promises to put an end to the war
                     with the Carthaginians.</p>

                     mercenaries has been gathered to hold the Syracusans in slavery; and he lords
                     it over the city, not like a magistrate dispensing justice on equal terms, but
                     like a dictator who by policy makes all decisions for his own advantage. For

                     the plague began with a catarrh; then came a swelling in the throat; gradually

                     physicians was of no avail both because of the severity of the disease and the
                     swiftness of the death; for death came on the fifth day or on the sixth at the

                     unfortunate. For not only did any not akin abandon one another, but even
                     brothers were forced to desert brothers, friends to sacrifice friends out of

                  <p> When Dionysius heard of the disaster that had struck the Carthaginians, he
                     manned eighty ships and ordered Pharacidas and Leptines the admirals to attack
                     the enemy's ships at daybreak, while he himself, profiting by a moonless night,
                     made a circuit with his army and, passing by the temple of Cyanê, arrived near

                  <p>The cavalry and a thousand infantry from the mercenaries were dispatched in
                     advance against that part of the Carthaginian encampment which extended toward
                     the interior. These mercenaries were the most hostile, beyond all others, to
                     Dionysius and had engaged time and again in factional quarrels and uproars.</p>

                     came to blows with the enemy they should flee and leave the mercenaries in the
                     lurch; when this order had been carried out and the mercenaries had been slain
                     to a man, Dionysius set about laying siege to both the camp and the forts.
                     While the barbarians were still dismayed at the unexpected attack and bringing
                     up reinforcements in disorderly fashion, he on his part took by storm the fort
                     known as Polichna; and on the opposite side the cavalry, aided in an attack by
                     some of the triremes, stormed the area around Dascon.</p>

                     war-cry at the taking of the forts, the barbarians were in a state of panic.
                     For at the outset they had rushed in a body against the land troops in order to
                     ward off the assailants of the camp; but when they saw the fleet also coming up
                     to attack, they turned back to give help to the naval station. The swift course
                     of events, however, outstripped them and their haste was without result.</p>

                     well-delivered blow would sink a damaged ship; but blows in repeated rammings,
                     which broke through the nailed timbers, struck terrible dismay into the

                     ridden on horseback to the section about Dascon. Finding there forty ships of
                     fifty oars, which had been drawn up on the beach, and beside them merchant
                     ships and some triremes at anchor, they set fire to them.</p>

                     caught the shipping, and none of the merchants or owners was able to bring any
                     help because of the violence of the blaze. Since a strong wind arose, the fires
                     carried from the ships drawn up on land to the merchantmen lying at anchor.</p>

                     cables were burnt off, the ships came into collision because of the rough seas,
                     some of them being destroyed as they struck one another, and others as the wind
                     drove them about, but the majority of them were victims of the fire.</p>

                     inhabitants of the city and the destruction of the barbarians resembled that of
                     men struck by lightning from heaven for their impiety. </p>

                     approaching without order all together made for the ships in the harbour. Those
                     which the fire had ruined they plundered, stripping them of anything that could
                     be saved, and such as were undamaged they took in tow and brought to the

                     together with their households, left their homes, everyone hurrying to the
                     walls, and the whole extent was crowded with spectators.</p>

                     applauding every success with great shouting, and the barbarians in their
                     consternation at the disaster keeping up a great uproar and confused

                     Syracusans. They asked him to allow their remaining troops to cross back to

                     Accordingly Dionysius agreed that the flight of the Carthaginians should take

                     territory, many of them were taken prisoner by the Rhegians. Dionysius, who was
                     on a quinquereme and many times narrowly escaped foundering, about midnight
                     barely found safety in the harbour of Messenê. Since the winter season had
                     already come, he drew up terms of alliance with the Leucani and led his forces

                  <p> After this, when the Leucanians overran the territory of Thurii, the Thurians
                     sent word to their allies to gather to them speedily under arms. For the Greek
                     cities of Italy had an agreement among themselves to the effect that if any
                     city's territory was being plundered by the Leucanians, they should all come to
                     its aid, and that if any city's army did not take up a position to give aid,

                     allies, but set forth against the Leucanians with above fourteen thousand
                     infantry and about one thousand cavalry.</p>

                     outpost and gathered much booty, thus taking the bait, as it were, for their
                     own destruction. For having become puffed with pride at their success, they
                     advanced with light concern through some narrow and sheer paths, in order to

                     unexpected and unconcealed, on the height, they filled the Greeks with dismay,
                     both because of the great size of the army and because of the difficulty of the
                     terrain; for the Leucanians had at the time thirty thousand infantry and no

                     among the Italian Greeks, having settled the war, as he had, to his own
                     advantage, but without any profit to Dionysius. For Dionysius hoped that, if
                     the Italian Greeks were embroiled in war with the Leucanians, he might appear
                     and easily make himself master of affairs in Italy, but if they were rid of
                     such a dangerous war, his success would be difficult. Consequently he relieved
                     Leptines of his command and appointed Thearides, his other brother, commander

                     Since the bulk of the Romans fled along the river and impeded one another by
                     reason of their disorder, the Celts were not behind-hand in slaying again and

                     had swum the river fled without their arms to Rome and reported that the whole
                     army had perished. When word of such misfortunes as we have described was

                     greatest danger since the enemy were close at hand. Now many private citizens
                     fled with their households to neighbouring cities, but the city magistrates,
                     encouraging the populace, issued orders for them to bring speedily to the
                     Capitoline grain and every other necessity. When this had been done, both the
                     acropolis and the Capitoline were stored not only with supplies of food but
                     with silver and gold and the costliest raiment, since the precious possessions
                     had been gathered from over the whole city into one place. They gathered such

                     inclines them to virtue to undertake, because of immortality fame accords them,
                     the fairest deeds, whereas by appropriate obloquies we shall turn men of the

                  <p>Consequently, since we have come in our writing to the period when the
                     Lacedaemonians fell upon deep distress in their unexpected defeat at Leuctra,
                     and again in their unlooked‑for repulse at Mantineia lost the supremacy over
                     the Greeks, we believe that we should maintain the principle we have set for

                     by the high spirit of their ancestors for over five hundred years, and now
                     beheld it, as the Lacedaemonians of that time did, overthrown by their own
                     folly? And this is easy to understand. For the men who had lived before them
                     won the glory they had by many labours and great struggles, treating their
                     subjects the while fairly and humanely; but their successors used their allies
                     roughly and harshly, stirring up, besides, unjust and insolent wars against the
                     Greeks, and so it is quite to be understood that they lost their rule because

                     unconquered from their ancestors' time were now attended by such contempt as,
                     it stands to reason, must befall those who obliterate the virtues that

                     among the Greeks, but the Lacedaemonians, when once they had lost the

                     gathered a large armament, both naval and land; his land force consisted of

                     These commanders took over the armaments in Phocaea and Cymê, repaired to
                     Cilicia, and passed over to Cyprus, where they prosecuted the war with vigour.

                     large sum of money to support his mercenary troops. Likewise he drew on such

                     more than this number from his allies. In addition to these he enlisted many
                     mercenaries, since he had funds in abundance. And not a few soldiers were sent

                     the supplies coming to the enemy, sank some of their ships at sea, drove off

                     was with difficulty that the generals of the Persians and the leader of the
                     naval armament, known as Glōs, put an end to the mutiny.</p>

                     two hundred triremes. These he fitted out for battle in a way to cause terror
                     and by continued trials and drill got ready for a sea engagement. Consequently,
                     when the King's fleet sailed past toward Citium, he fell upon the ships

                     confident of success, but when he suffered defeat in the sea-fight and found

                     war upon Mantineia, without regard to the standing treaty, for the following
                     reasons. The Greeks were enjoying the general peace of Antalcidas, in
                     accordance with which all the cities had got rid of their garrisons and
                     recovered by agreement their autonomy. The Lacedaemonians, however, who by
                     their nature loved to command and by policy preferred war, would not tolerate
                     the peace which they considered to be a heavy burden, and longing for their
                     past dominance over Greece, they were poised and alert to begin a new movement.

                  <p>At once, then, they stirred up the cities and formed partisan groups in them
                     with the aid of their friends, being provided in some of the cities with
                     plausible grounds for interference. For the cities, after having recovered
                     their autonomy, demanded an accounting of the men who had been in control under
                     the Lacedaemonian supremacy; and since the procedure was harsh, because the
                     people bore enmity for past injuries and many were sent into exile, the
                     Lacedaemonians took it upon themselves to give support to the defeated faction.

                     on and forced the more important cities to submit, having preserved the general
                     peace no longer than two years. </p>
                  <p> Seeing that the city of the Mantineians lay upon their borders and was full of
                     valiant men, the Lacedaemonians were jealous of its growth which had resulted

                     wars with the Carthaginians, enjoyed great peace and leisure. Consequently he
                     devoted himself with much seriousness to the writing of poetry, and summoning
                     men of repute in this line, he accorded them special honours and resorted to
                     them, making use of them as instructors and revisers of his poems. Elated by
                     the flattering words with which these men repaid his benefactions, Dionysius

                     enjoyed very high repute as a composer in his own line. After dinner, when the
                     compositions of the tyrant, which were wretched, had been read, he was asked
                     what was his judgement of the poetry. When he replied with a good deal of
                     frankness, the tyrant, offended at his words, found fault with him that he had
                     been moved by jealousy to use scurrilous language and commanded his servants to
                     drag him off forthwith to the quarries.</p>

                     pardon, Dionysius made up with him and again included the same men in his
                     company after dinner. As the drinking advanced, again Dionysius boasted of the
                     poetry he had written, recited some lines which he considered to be happily
                     composed, and then asked, "What do you think of the verses?" To this Philoxenus
                     said not a word, but called Dionysius' servants and ordered them to take him
                     away to the quarries.</p>

                     time later his acquaintances and Dionysius as well asked him to desist from his
                     untimely frankness, Philoxenus made a paradoxical offer. He would, he said, in
                     his answer both respect the truth and keep the favour of Dionysius. Nor did he
                     fail to make his word good.</p>

                     double promise by the ambiguity. For Dionysius took the word "pitiful" as
                     signifying harrowing and deeply moving, which are successful effects of good
                     poets, and therefore rated him as having approved them; the rest, however, who
                     caught the real meaning, conceived that the word "pitiful" was only employed to
                     suggest failure. </p>

                  <p> Much the same thing, as it happened, also occurred in the case of Plato the
                     philosopher. Dionysius summoned this man to his court and at first deigned to
                     show him the highest favour, since he saw that he practised the freedom of
                     speech that philosophy is entitled to. But later, being offended at some of his
                     statements, he became altogether alienated from him, exposed him in the market,
                     and sold him as a slave for twenty minas. Those who were philosophers, however,
                     joined together, purchased his freedom, and sent him off to Greece with the
                     friendly admonition that a wise man should associate with tyrants either as
                     little as possible or with the best grace possible. </p>

                     performance of his poems for the assembled throng. At first their pleasing

                     all his friends of plotting against him. At last his frenzy and madness went so
                     far that he slew many of his friends on false charges, and he drove not a few

                     should obey the King as a king, whereas he had himself agreed upon a peace on
                     the terms that Evagoras should obey the King as a slave his master. With
                     respect to the oracle he stated that the god as a general thing gives no
                     response concerning death, and to the truth of this he invoked all the Greeks
                     present as witnesses. As for the friendship with the Lacedaemonians, he replied

                     but for the profit of the King; and he pointed out that the Greeks of Asia were
                     thereby detached from the Lacedaemonians and delivered captive to the King. At

                     means of which they curbed the barbarians' great audacity. </p>
                  <p> While these events were taking place, the Parians, in accordance with an
                     oracle, sent out a colony to the Adriatic, founding it on the island of Pharos,
                     as it is called, with the co‑operation of the tyrant Dionysius. He had already
                     dispatched a colony to the Adriatic not many years previously and had founded
                     the city known as Lissus.</p>

                     dockyards with a capacity for two hundred triremes and threw about the city a
                     wall of such size that its circuit was the greatest possessed by any Greek
                     city. He also constructed large gymnasia along the Anapus River, and likewise
                     temples of the gods and whatever else would contribute to the growth and renown
                     of the city. </p>

                     celebrated the Ninety-ninth Olympiad, that in which Dicon of Syracuse won the
                     "stadion." This year the Parians, who had settled Pharos, allowed the previous
                     barbarian inhabitants to remain unharmed in an exceedingly well fortified
                     place, while they themselves founded a city by the sea and built a wall about

                     These, to the number of more than ten thousand, crossed over to Pharos in many
                     small boats, wrought havoc, and slew many of the Greeks. But the governor of
                     Lissus appointed by Dionysius sailed with a good number of triremes against the
                     light craft of the Illyrians, sinking some and capturing others, and slew more
                     than five thousand of the barbarians, while taken some two thousand captive.

                     he was going to pillage a holy temple, richly provided with dedications, which
                     was located in the seaport of the Tyrrhenian city of Agyllê, the name of the
                     port being Pyrgi.</p>

                     plundered the temple, and amassed no less than a thousand talents. When the men
                     of Agyllê came out to bring help, he overpowered them in battle, took many
                     prisoners, laid waste their territory, and then returned to Syracuse. From the
                     booty which he sold he took in no less than five hundred talents. Now that
                     Dionysius was well supplied with money, he hired a multitude of soldiers from
                     every land, and after bringing together a very considerable army, was obviously
                     preparing for a war against the Carthaginians. </p>

                  <p> When Phanostratus was archon in Athens, the Romans elected instead of consuls
                     four military tribunes, Lucius Lucretius, Sentius Sulpicius, Lucius Aemilius,
                     and Lucius Furius. This year Dionysius, the tyrant of the Syracusans, after
                     preparations for war upon the Carthaginians, looked about to find a reasonable
                     excuse for the conflict. Seeing, then, that the cities subject to the
                     Carthaginians were favourable to a revolt, he received such as wished to do so,
                     formed an alliance with them, and treated them with fairness.</p>

                  <p>The Carthaginians at first dispatched ambassadors to the ruler and asked for

                     be the beginning of the war. </p>
                  <p> Now the Carthaginians formed an alliance with the Italian Greeks and together
                     with them went to war against the tyrant; and since they wisely recognized in
                     advance that it would be a great war, they enrolled as soldiers capable youth
                     from their own citizens, and then, raising a great sum of money, hired large
                     forces of mercenary troops. As general they chose their king Magon and moved
                     many tens of thousands of soldiers across to Sicily and Italy, planning to wage
                     war on both fronts.</p>

                  <p>Dionysius for his part also divided his forces, on the one front fighting the
                     Italian Greeks and on the other the Phoenicians. Now there were many battles
                     here and there between groups of soldiers and minor and continuous engagements,
                     in which nothing of consequence was achieved. But there were two important and
                     famous pitched battles. In the first, near Cabala, as it is called, Dionysius,
                     who put up an admirable fight, was victorious, slaying more than ten thousand
                     of the barbarians and capturing not less than five thousand. He also forced the
                     rest of the army to take refuge on a hill which was fortified but altogether
                     without water. There fell also Magon their king after a splendid combat.</p>

                  <p>The Phoenicians, dismayed at the magnitude of the disaster, at once sent an
                     embassy to discuss terms of peace. But Dionysius declared that his only terms
                     were cardinal upon their retiring from the cities of Sicily and paying the cost

                     they outgeneralled Dionysius with their accustomed knavery. They pretended that
                     they were satisfied with the terms, but stated that it was not in their power
                     to hand over the cities; and in order that they might discuss the question with
                     their government, they asked Dionysius to agree to a truce of a few days.</p>

                     Carthaginians meanwhile gave their king Magon a magnificent funeral and
                     replaced him as general with his son, who, though he was young indeed, was full
                     of ambition and distinguished for his courage. He spent the entire period of
                     the truce drilling and exercising his troops, and what with laborious exercise,
                     hortatory speeches, and training in arms, he rendered the army obedient and
                     competent.</p>

                     Choosing by lot from their own citizens, they founded near Leucê a city from
                     which they made their start at the rising of the sun and thus forestalled the

                  <p> When Evander was archon at Athens, the Romans elected six military tribunes
                     with consular power, Quintus Sulpicius, Gaius Fabius, Quintus Servilius,
                     Publius Cornelius. During their term of office, the Lacedaemonian took
                     possession of the Cadmeia in Thebes for the following reasons. Seeing that
                     Boeotia had a large number of cities and that her inhabitants were men of
                     outstanding valour, while Thebes, still retaining her renown of ancient times,
                     was, generally speaking, the citadel of Boeotia, they were mindful of the
                     danger that Thebes, if a suitable occasion arose, might claim the leadership of
                     Greece.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="2">
                  <p>Accordingly the Spartans gave secret instructions to their commanders, if ever
                     they found an opportunity, to take possession of the Cadmeia. Acting under
                     these instructions, Phoebidas the Spartan, who had been assigned to a command
                     and was leading an expeditionary force against Olynthus, seized the Cadmeia.
                     When the Thebans, resenting this act, gathered under arms, he joined battle
                     with them and after defeating them exiled three hundred of the most eminent
                     Thebans. Then after he had terrorized the rest and had stationed a strong
                     garrison in the Cadmeia, he went off on his own business. For this act the
                     Lacedaemonians, being now discredited in the eyes of the Greeks, punished
                     Phoebidas with a fine but would not remove the garrison from Thebes.</p>

               <div

                  <p>So the Thebans in this way lost their independence and were compelled to take
                     orders from the Lacedaemonians. As the Olynthians continued the war against
                     Amyntas, king of the Macedonians, the Lacedaemonians relieved Phoebidas of his
                     command, and installed Phoebidas' brother Eudamidas as general. Giving him
                     three thousand hoplites, they dispatched him to carry on the war against the
                     Olynthians. </p>

                     Amyntas, continued to wage war upon the Olynthians. Thereupon the Olynthians,
                     who had collected a considerable force, had the better in the field because
                     they had more soldiers than the enemy; but the Lacedaemonians, having made
                     ready a considerable force, appointed Teleutias general in charge of it.
                     Teleutias was brother of King Agesilaüs and was greatly admired for his valour
                     by his fellow citizens.</p>

                     Being now a match for the enemy, he began by plundering the Olynthian territory
                     and dividing among his troops the booty that he had collected; but when the
                     Olynthians and their allies in full force took the field, he gave battle. At
                     first they drew apart after an even contest, but later a stubborn battle was
                     fought in which Teleutias himself fell after a splendid fight and the
                     Lacedaemonians lost more than twelve hundred men.</p>

                     numerous forces, while the Olynthians, judging that the Spartans would come
                     with larger forces and that the war would last for a long time, prepared large

                     cause of liberty. For the Lacedaemonians, relying on the size of the force at
                     their disposal, ruled their subject peoples inconsiderately and severely, and
                     consequently many of those who belonged to the Spartan sphere of influence fell

                     others of the islanders; and as the movement steadily gathered force throughout
                     Greece, many cities attached themselves to the Athenians. The democracy, elated
                     by the loyalty of the cities, established a common council of all the allies
                     and appointed representatives of each state.</p>

                     enjoy but one vote, and that all should continue independent, accepting the
                     Athenians as leaders. The Lacedaemonians, aware that the movement of their
                     cities to secede could not be checked, nevertheless strove earnestly by means

                     and restored their freedom to the people of Oreüs. For this reason the people
                     who inhabit what is known as the country of the Hestiaeans continued to be

                     allies more loyal. And now that they saw that the war was becoming more serious
                     and required strict attention, they set ambitiously to work on their various

                     third the Arcadians, the fourth the Eleians, the fifth the Achaeans.
                     Corinthians and Megarians supplied the sixth, the seventh the Sicyonians and

                     Olynthians and the allies who lived in Thrace. They reckoned one hoplite to two

                     admiration and especially when the Lacedaemonians were fighting the Persians.
                     For he gave battle and won the victory over a force of many times his own

                     finally would probably have succeeded, had not the Spartans recalled him

                     him their surprise that Agesilaüs, who reputedly was a man of energy and had
                     the larger and more powerful force, should have avoided a decisive contest with
                     the enemy. To them Agesilaüs made answer that, as it was, the Lacedaemonians
                     had won the victory without the risk; for when the countryside was being
                     sacked, the Boeotians had not dared to rally to its defence; but if, when the
                     enemy themselves had conceded the victory, he had forced them to endure the
                     risks of battle, perhaps through the uncertainty of fortune the Lacedaemonians
                     might even have come to grief in the contest.</p>

                  <p>Now at the time he was thought in this reply of his to have estimated the
                     possible outcome fairly well, but later in the light of events he was believed
                     to have uttered no mere human saying but a divinely inspired oracle. For the
                     Lacedaemonians, having taken the field against the Thebans with a mighty army
                     and having compelled them to fight for their freedom, met with a great

                     at Mantineia, they were utterly routed and hopelessly lost their supremacy. For
                     fortune has a knack, when men vaunt themselves too highly, of laying them
                     unexpectedly low and so teaching them to hope for nothing in excess. At any
                     rate Agesilaüs, prudently satisfied with his first success, brought his army

                     gallant deeds in war, was particularly proud of this bit of strategy and he
                     caused the statues which had been granted to him by his people to be erected to

                     Agesilaüs, behold the multitude of men streaming down upon him, summoned his
                     soldiers by trumpet to withdraw from the battle. The Thebans, who found
                     themselves now for the first time not inferior to the Lacedaemonians, erected a

                     about the same time occurred a great naval battle between Naxos and Paros, of
                     which the cause was as follows. Pollis, the admiral of the Lacedaemonians,
                     learning that a large shipment of grain was on its way to Athens in freighters,
                     lay in wait watching for the grain fleet as it put in to port, intending to
                     attack the freighters. The Athenian people, being informed of this, sent out a
                     convoy to guard the grain in transit, which in fact brought it safe to the
                     Peiraeus.</p>

                  <p>Later Chabrias, the Athenian admiral, with the whole navy sailed to Naxos and
                     laid it under siege. Bringing his siege-engines to bear against the walls, when
                     he had shaken them, he then bent every effort to take the city by storm. While
                     these things were going on, Pollis, the admiral of the Lacedaemonians, sailed
                     into port to assist the Naxians. In eager rivalry both sides engaged in a
                     sea-battle, and forming in line of battle charged each other.</p>

                  <p>Pollis had sixty-five triremes; Chabrias eighty-three. As the ships bore down
                     on one another, Pollis, leading the right wing, was first to attack the
                     opposing triremes on the left wing, which Cedon the Athenian commanded. In a
                     brilliant contest he slew Cedon himself and sank his ship; and, in similar
                     fashion engaging the other ships of Cedon and tearing them open with the beaks
                     of his ships, he destroyed some and others he forced to flee.</p>

                     retrieved the defeat of his own side. He himself with the strongest part of the
                     fleet in a valiant struggle destroyed many triremes and took a large number

                     flee, he abstained altogether from pursuit. For he recalled the battle of
                     Arginusae and that the assembly of the people, in return for the great service
                     performed by victorious generals, condemned them to death on the charge that
                     they had failed to bury the men who had perished in the fight; consequently he
                     was afraid, since the circumstances were much the same, that he might run the
                     risk of a similar fate. Accordingly, refraining from pursuit, he gathered up
                     the bodies of his fellow citizens which were afloat, saved those who still
                     lived, and buried the dead. Had he not engaged in this task he would easily
                     have destroyed the whole enemy fleet.</p>

                     Chabrias then, having won a notable victory, sailed back laden with spoils to
                     the Peiraeus and met with an enthusiastic reception from his fellow citizens.
                     Since the Peloponnesian War this was the first naval battle the Athenians had

                  <p> The Thebans, who excelled in bodily strength and prowess and had already
                     conquered the Lacedaemonians in numerous battles, were elated in spirit and
                     eager to dispute the supremacy on land. Nor were they cheated of their hope,
                     both for the aforesaid reasons and because they had more good commanders and
                     generals during the period under consideration.</p>

                  <p>Most famous were Pelopidas, Gorgidas, and Epameinondas. Epameinondas, indeed,
                     far excelled not merely those of his own race but even all Greeks in valour and
                     shrewdness in the art of war. He had a broad general education, being
                     particularly interested in the philosophy of Pythagoras. Besides this, being
                     well endowed with physical advantages, it is natural that he contributed very
                     distinguished achievements. Hence even when compelled with a very few citizen
                     soldiers to fight against all the armies of the Lacedaemonians and their
                     allies, he was so far superior to these heretofore invincible warriors that he
                     slew the Spartan king Cleombrotus, and almost completely annihilated the
                     multitude of his opponents.</p>

                     great disturbances and internal strife, particularly in the Peloponnese. Having
                     been used to oligarchic institutions and now taking foolish advantage of the
                     liberties which democracy allows itself, they exiled many of their good
                     citizens, and, trumping up charges against them, condemned them. Thus falling
                     into internal strife they had recourse to exilings and confiscations of
                     property, particularly against those who during the Spartan hegemony had been
                     leaders of their native cities.</p>

                     their fellow citizens, and later as the democratic mob recovered is freedom it
                     harboured a grudge. First, however, the exiles of Phialeia, rallying their
                     forces, recovered Heraea, as it is called, a stronghold. And setting out from
                     there, they swooped down upon Phialeia, and at a time when, as it happened, the
                     festival of Dionysus was being celebrated, they fell unexpectedly upon the
                     spectators in the theatre, killed many, persuaded not a few to participate in
                     their folly, and retreated to Sparta.</p>

                     their relatives and friends, they were denounced and surrounded, and, as they
                     were about to be apprehended, fearful of the maltreatment their capture would
                     entail, they slew one another. The Corinthians, having charged many of their
                     citizens with assisting the exiles in the attack, put some to death and exiled

                     driven into exile. Likewise among the Sicyonians as well a number who tried to

                     fought against the city party, and, when the exiles won the victory, over three
                     hundred of the Phliasians were slain. Later, as the sentinels betrayed the
                     exiles, the Phliasians got the upper hand and executed more than six hundred
                     exiles, while they drove the rest out of the country and compelled them to take
                     refuge in Argos. Such were the disasters that afflicted the Peloponnesian

                     and a wooden bridge commanding its entrance. He especially fortified the
                     Pelusiac mouth because it is the first to be encountered by those approaching

                     sea approaches by embankments. Accordingly it was not easy either for the ships

                     through it and decided to make the invasion by ship through another mouth.
                     Accordingly they voyaged on the open sea so that the ships should not be
                     sighted by the enemy, and sailed in by the mouth known as Mendesian, which had
                     a beach stretching over a considerable space. Landing here with three thousand
                     men, Pharnabazus and Iphicrates pushed forward to the walled stronghold at the

                  <p>The Egyptians rushed out with three thousand horse and infantry, and a sharp

                     Persians, until finally the Egyptians were surrounded, many slain, and not a
                     few captured alive; and the rest were driven in confusion into the city.
                     Iphicrates' men dashed in with the defenders inside the walls, took possession
                     of the fortress, razed it, and enslaved the inhabitants. </p>

                  <p> After this, discord set in amongst the commanders, causing the failure of the
                     enterprise. For Iphicrates, learning from the captives that Memphis, the most
                     strategically situated of the Egyptian cities, was undefended, advised sailing
                     immediately up to Memphis before the Egyptian forces arrived there, but
                     Pharnabazus thought they should await the entire Persian force; for in this way

                     promised if he had them to capture the city, Pharnabazus became suspicious of
                     his boldness and his courage for fear lest he take possession of Egypt for
                     himself. Accordingly when Pharnabazus would not yield, Iphicrates protested
                     that if they let slip the exact moment of opportunity, they would make the
                     whole campaign a failure. Some generals indeed bore a grudge against him and
                     were attempting to fasten unfair charges upon him.</p>

                  <p>Meanwhile the Egyptians, having had plenty of time to recuperate, first sent an
                     adequate garrison into Memphis, and then, proceeding with all their forces
                     against the ravaged stronghold at the Mendesian mouth of the Nile and being now
                     at a great advantage owing to the strength their position, fought constant
                     engagements with the enemy. With ever-increasing strength they slew many
                     Persians and gained confidence against them.</p>

                  <p>As the campaign about this stronghold dragged on, and the Etesian winds had
                     already set in, the Nile, which was filling up and flooding the whole region
                     with the abundance of its waters, made Egypt daily more secure. The Persian
                     commanders, as this state of affairs constantly operated against them, decided
                     to withdraw from Egypt.</p>

                  <p>Consequently, on their way back to Asia, when a disagreement arose between him

                     as Conon the Athenian had been, decided to flee secretly from the camp.
                     Accordingly, having secured a ship he covertly got away at night and reached

                     to the Persians that if they detected him in wrongdoing they would punish him
                     as he deserved, and shortly afterward appointed Iphicrates general in command

                     remarkable character of Iphicrates. For he is reported to have possessed
                     shrewdness in common and to have enjoyed an exceptional natural genius for
                     every kind of useful invention. Hence we are told, after he had acquired his
                     long experience of military operations in the Persian War, he devised many
                     improvements in the tools of war, devoting himself especially to the matter of
                     arms.</p>

                  <p>For instance, the Greeks were using shields which were large and consequently
                     difficult to handle; these he discarded and made small oval ones of moderate
                     size, thus successfully achieving both objects, to furnish the body with
                     adequate cover and to enable the user of the small shield, on account of its
                     lightness, to be completely free in his movements.</p>

                  <p>After a trial of the new shield its easy manipulation secured its adoption, and
                     the infantry who had formerly been called "hoplites" because of their heavy
                     shield, then had their name changed to "peltasts" from the light pelta they
                     carried. As regards spear and sword, he made changes in the contrary direction:
                     namely, he increased the length of the spears by half, and made the swords
                     almost twice as long. The actual use of these arms confirmed the initial test
                     and from the success of the experiment won great fame for the inventive genius
                     of the general.</p>

                     useful improvements into warfare, but it would be tedious to write about them.
                     So the Persian expedition against Egypt, for all its huge preparations,
                     disappointed expectations and proved a failure in the end. </p>

                     unwonted forms of government, and many uprisings were occurring in the midst of
                     the general anarchy, the Lacedaemonians gave assistance to such as were trying
                     to establish oligarchies, while the Athenians supported those groups which
                     clung to democracy.</p>

                     respecting the general peace that had been agreed upon. So it came about that
                     in Zacynthos the popular party, being angry and resentful toward those who had
                     held control of the government during the domination of the Lacedaemonians,
                     drove them all into exile. . . . These Zacynthians, having taken refuge with
                     Timotheüs the Athenian in charge of the fleet, joined his naval force and
                     fought with him.</p>

                     as their base and having the support of Timotheüs they inflicted damage upon
                     those in the city. </p>

                     Athenian people favoured the exiles, they organized a fleet, and manning
                     twenty-five triremes sent them to assist the Zacynthians, placing Aristocrates

                     a fleet, promising to betray Corcyra to them. The Lacedaemonians, aware of the
                     great importance that Corcyra had for the aspirants to sea power, made haste to

                     causes, whereas those who are disposed to venerate the divine power assign
                     certain plausible reasons for the occurrence, alleging that the disaster was

                  <p> In Ionia nine cities were in the habit of holding sacrifices of great
                     antiquity on a large scale to Poseidon in a lonely region near the place called
                     Mycalê. Later, however, as a result of the outbreak of wars in this
                     neighbourhood, since they were unable to hold the Panionia there, they shifted
                     the festival gathering to a safe place near Ephesus. Having sent an embassy to
                     Delphi, they received an oracle telling them to take copies of the ancient
                     ancestral altars at Helicê, which was situated in what was then known as Ionia,
                     but is now known as Achaïa.</p>

                  <p>So the Ionians in obedience to the oracle sent men to Achaïa to make the
                     copies, and they spoke before the council of the Achaeans and persuaded them to
                     give them what they asked. The inhabitants of Helicê, however, who had an
                     ancient saying that they would suffer danger when Ionians should sacrifice at
                     the altar of Poseidon, taking account of the oracle, opposed the Ionians in the
                     matter of the copies, saying that the sanctuary was not the common property of
                     the Achaeans, but their own particular possession. The inhabitants of Bura also
                     took part with them in this.</p>

                     at the altar of Poseidon as the oracle directed, but the people of Helicê
                     scattered the sacred possessions of the Ionians and seized the persons of their
                     representatives, thus committing sacrilege. It was because of these acts, they
                     say, that Poseidon in his anger brought ruin upon the offending cities through
                     the earthquake and the flood.</p>

                     over earthquakes and floods belongs to this god, and also it is the ancient
                     belief that the Peloponnese was an habitation of Poseidon; and this country is
                     regarded as sacred in a way to Poseidon, and, speaking generally, all the
                     cities in the Peloponnese pay honour to this god more than to any other of the
                     immortals.</p>

                  <p>Furthermore, the Peloponnese has beneath its surface huge caverns and get
                     underground accumulations of flowing water. Indeed the two rivers in it which
                     clearly have underground courses; one of them, in fact, near Pheneüs, plunges
                     into the ground, and in former times completely disappeared, swallowed up by
                     underground caves, and the other, near Stymphalus, plunges into a chasm and
                     flows for two hundred stades concealed underground, then pours forth by the

                  <p>During their term of office, after the Lacedaemonians had held the supremacy in
                     Greece for almost five hundred years, a divine portent foretold the loss of
                     their empire; for there was seen in the heavens during the course of many
                     nights a great blazing torch which was named from its shape a "flaming beam,"
                     and a little later, to the surprise of all, the Spartans were defeated in a
                     great battle and irretrievably lost their supremacy.</p>

                  <p>Some of the students of nature ascribed the origin of the torch to natural
                     causes, voicing the opinion that such apparitions occur of necessity at
                     appointed times, and that in these matters the Chaldaeans in Babylon and the
                     other astrologers succeeded in making accurate prophecies. These men, they say,
                     are not surprised when such a phenomenon occurs, but rather if it does not,
                     since each particular constellation has its own peculiar cycle and they
                     complete these cycles through age-long movements in appointed courses. At any
                     rate this torch had such brilliancy, they report, and its light such strength
                     that it cast shadows on the rather similar to those cast by the moon. </p>

                  <p>At this time Artaxerxes the Persian King, seeing that the Greek world was again
                     in a turmoil, sent ambassadors, calling upon the Greeks to settle their
                     internecine wars and establish a common peace in accordance with the covenants
                     they had formerly made. All the Greeks gladly received this proposal, and all
                     the cities agreed to a general peace except Thebes; for the Thebans alone,
                     being engaged in bringing Boeotia under a single confederacy, were not admitted
                     by the Greeks because of the general determination to have the oaths and
                     treaties made city by city. So, remaining outside of the treaties as formerly,
                     the Thebans continued to hold Boeotia in a single confederacy subject to

                     their increase of power, fearing lest with the leadership of all Boeotia they
                     might break up the Spartan supremacy, given a suitable opportunity. For they
                     constantly practised gymnastics and had great bodily strength, and since they
                     were naturally lovers of war, they were inferior to no Greek nation in deeds of

                     was full of pride because of the glory of its ancestors in the heroic age and
                     aspired to mighty deeds. In this year, then, the Lacedaemonians were making
                     ready for war, levying armies both of their own citizens and from their allies

                  <p> When Phrasicleides was archon at Athens, the Romans elected eight military
                     tribunes with consular power, Publius Manius, Gaius Erenucius, Gaius Sextus,
                     Tiberius Julius, Lucius Lavinius, Publius Tribonius, and Gaius Manlius, and
                     besides Lucius Anthestius. During their term of office the Thebans, since they
                     were not participants in the truce, were forced to undertake alone the war with
                     the Lacedaemonians; for there was no city that could legally join them, because
                     all had agreed to the general peace.</p>

                     their preparations without concealment and the Thebans were destitute of
                     allies, everyone assumed that they would be easily defeated by the

                     were overjoyed at the thought that Thebes would in a trice be reduced to utter
                     slavery. Finally the Lacedaemonians, their huge army ready, gave command of it
                     to Cleombrotus their king, and first of all sent envoys ahead to Thebes,
                     directing the Thebans to permit all of the Boeotian cities to be independent,
                     to people Plataea and Thespiae, and to restore the land to its former

                     their answers, the Lacedaemonians sent Cleombrotus forth immediately with his
                     army against Thebes; and the Spartan allies were eager for the war, confident
                     that there would be no contest or battle but that they would master the

                     view of the presence of the enemy, first voted to remove their wives and
                     children to safety in Athens, then chose Epameinondas general and turned over

                  <p>As the soldiers were marching out from the city it seemed to many that
                     unfavourable omens appeared to the armament. For by the gates Epameinondas was
                     met by a blind herald, who, seeking recovery of runaway slaves, just as was
                     usual, cried his warning not to take them from Thebes nor to spirit them away,
                     but to bring them home and keep them secure.</p>

                  <p>Now the older people amongst those who heard the herald considered it an omen
                     for the future; but the younger folk kept quiet so as not to appear through
                     cowardice to hold Epameinondas back from the expedition. But Epameinondas
                     replied to those who told him that he must observe the omens: </p>
                  <p> One only omen is best, to fight for the land that is ours." </p>

                     omen appeared more unfavourable than the previous one. For as the clerk
                     advanced with a spear and a ribbon attached to it and signalled the orders from
                     headquarters, a breeze came up and, as it happened, the ribbon was torn from
                     the spear and wrapped itself around a slab that stood over a grave, and there
                     were buried in this spot some Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesians who had died in
                     the expedition under Agesilaüs.</p>

                  <p>Some of the older folk who again chanced to be there protested earnestly

                     but Epameinondas, deigning them no reply, led forth his army, thinking that
                     considerations of nobility and regard for justice should be preferred as
                     motives to the omens in question.</p>

                  <p>Epameinondas accordingly, who was trained in philosophy and applied sensibly

                     in the light of his successes would considered to have excelled in military
                     shrewdness and did contribute the greatest benefits to his country. For he
                     immediately led forth his army, seized in advance the pass at Coroneia, and
                     encamped there. </p>

                  <p>Cleombrotus, learning that the enemy had seized the pass first, decided against
                     forcing a passage there, proceeded instead through Phocis, and, when he had
                     traversed the shore road which was difficult, entered Boeotia without danger.
                     In his passage he took some of the fortresses and seized ten triremes.</p>

                  <p>Later, when he reached the place called Leuctra, he encamped there and allowed
                     the soldiers to recover after their march. As the Boeotians neared the enemy in
                     their advance, and then, after surmounting some ridges, suddenly caught sight
                     of the Lacedaemonians covering the entire plain of Leuctra, they were astounded

                  <p>And when the boeotarchs held a conference to decide whether they ought to
                     remain and fight it out with an army that many times outnumbered them, or
                     whether they should retreat and join battle in a commanding position, it
                     chanced that the votes of the leaders were equal. For of the six boeotarchs,
                     three thought that they should withdraw the army, and three that they should
                     stay and fight it out, and among the latter Epameinondas was numbered. In this
                     great and perplexing deadlock, the boeotarch came to vote, whom Epameinondas
                     persuaded to vote with him, and thus he carried the day. So the decision to
                     stake all on the issue of battle was thus ratified.</p>

                     strategy to reverse the scruples of the soldiery. Accordingly, a number of men
                     having recently arrived from Thebes, he persuaded them to say that the arms on
                     the temple of Heracles had surprisingly disappeared and that word had gone
                     abroad in Thebes that the heroes of old had taken them up and set off to help
                     the Boeotians. He placed before them another man as one who had recently
                     ascended from the cave of Trophonius, who said that the god had directed them,
                     when they won at Leuctra, to institute a contest with crowns for prizes in
                     honour of Zeus the king. This indeed is the origin of this festival which the
                     Boeotians now celebrate at Lebadeia. </p>

                     daughters of Leuctrus and Scedasus for the following reasons.</p>

                     against the outstanding citizens of property and reputation. The victims of the

                     condemned to death all the accused, who were many and wealthy. When, however,
                     more than twelve hundred influential men had been removed, the populace did not

                     their accusation, whereas the mob, now thinking that they had been left in the
                     lurch by them, were angry at this and put to death all the demagogues. So these

                     refugees. He reached the Arcadian Orchomenus and guarded it closely since it
                     was on friendly terms with Sparta.</p>

                     the city a great battle ensued in which the Lacedaemonian general was killed
                     and two hundred others, while the rest were driven into the city.</p>

                  <p>The Arcadians, in spite of their victory, felt a prudent respect for the
                     strength of Sparta and believed that they would not be able by themselves to
                     cope with the Lacedaemonians. Accordingly, associating Argives and Eleians with
                     themselves, they first sent envoys to Athens requesting them to join in an
                     alliance against the Spartans, but as no one heeded them, they sent an embassy
                     to the Thebans and persuaded them to join an alliance against the

                     the boeotarchs Epameinondas and Pelopidas, for the other boeotarchs had
                     willingly relinquished the command to these in recognition of their shrewdness

                     were, taking all together, restricted by the blows of fortune to but few
                     citizen soldiers, and, furthermore, since some of their allies had seceded and
                     others were experiencing a shortage of men for reasons similar to their own,
                     they sank into a state of great weakness. Hence they were compelled to have
                     recourse to the aid of the Athenians, the very people over whom they had once
                     set up thirty tyrants, whom they had forbidden to rebuild the walls of their
                     city, whose city they had aimed utterly to destroy, and whose territory,

                     they were not disappointed of their hopes. For the Athenian people, magnanimous
                     and generous, were not terrified by the power of Thebes, and voted to aid with
                     all their forces the Lacedaemonians now that they were in danger of
                     enslavement. Immediately they appointed Iphicrates general and dispatched him
                     with twelve thousand young men the self-same day. Iphicrates, then, whose men
                     were in high spirits, advanced with the army at top speed.</p>

                     useful to his country to preserve the men. He therefore in an amazing manner

                     into confusion by the difficulty of the crossing, seized the opportunity
                     favourable for attack. Leaving the women, children, and the old men as well in
                     the city to guard Sparta, they marshalled in full force the men of military
                     age, streamed forth against the enemy, fell upon them suddenly as they crossed,

                     those who pressed rashly forward, but finally the besiegers applied great
                     pressure and thought at first they had overcome Sparta by force; but as those
                     who tried to force their way were some slain, some wounded, Epameinondas
                     recalled the soldiers with the trumpet, but the men of their own accord would
                     approach the city, and would challenge the Spartans to a pitched battle,

                     allies, to the number of four thousand men, came to reinforce the
                     Lacedaemonians. Besides these they attached to their numbers the Helots who had
                     been newly emancipated, a thousand, and two hundred of the Boeotian fugitives,
                     and summoned no small number from the neighbouring cities, so that they created
                     an army comparable to that of the enemy. As they maintained these in one body
                     and trained them, they gained more and more confidence and made themselves

                     everlasting fame, counselled the Arcadians and his other allies to resettle
                     Messenê, which for many years had remained stripped of its inhabitants by the
                     Lacedaemonians, for it occupied a position well suited for operations against
                     Sparta. When they all concurred, he sought out the remnants of the Messenians,
                     and registering as citizens any others who so wished he founded Messenê again,
                     making it a populous city. Among them he divided the land, and reconstructing
                     its buildings restored a notable Greek city and gained the widespread

                     razed, to recapitulate its history from the beginning. In ancient times the
                     line of Neleus and Nestor held it down to Trojan times; then Orestes,
                     Agamemnon's son, and his descendants down to the return of the Heracleidae;
                     following which Cresphontes received Messenê as his portion and his line ruled
                     it for a time; but later when Cresphontes' descendants had lost the kingship,
                     the Lacedaemonians became masters of it.</p>

                  <p>After this, at the death of the Lacedaemonian king Teleclus, the Messenians
                     were defeated in a war by the Lacedaemonians. This war is said to have lasted
                     twenty years, for the Lacedaemonians had taken an oath not to return to Sparta
                     unless they should have captured Messenê. Then it was that the children called
                     partheniae were born and founded the city of Tarentum. Later, however, while
                     the Messenians were in slavery to the Lacedaemonians, Aristomenes persuaded the
                     Messenians to revolt from the Spartans, and he inflicted many defeats upon the
                     Spartans at the time when the poet Tyrtaeus was given by the Athenians as a
                     leader to Sparta.</p>

                     between them was on the occasion of a great earthquake; practically all Sparta
                     was destroyed and left bare of men, and the remnants of the Messenians settled
                     Ithomê with the aid of the Helots who joined the revolt, after Messenê had for
                     a long time been desolate.</p>

                     them for an abode. Furthermore some of their number were exiled to Cephallenia,

                     sent to Athens a commission of the most distinguished Spartans, and came to an
                     agreement over the supremacy: the Athenians should be masters of the sea, the

                  <p> It is not out of keeping with the present narrative to recount the cause of
                     his death and the events which befell this dynast toward the end of his life.
                     Now Dionysius had produced a tragedy at the Lenaea at Athens and had won the
                     victory, and one of those who sang in the chorus, supposing he would be
                     rewarded handsomely if he were the first to give news of the victory, set sail
                     to Corinth. There, finding a ship bound for Sicily, he transferred to it, and
                     obtaining favouring winds, speedily landed at Syracuse and gave the tyrant news
                     of the victory.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="2">
                  <p>Dionysius did reward him, and was himself so overjoyed that he sacrificed to
                     the gods for the good tidings and instituted a drinking bout and great feasts.
                     As he entertained his friends lavishly and during the bout applied himself
                     overzealously to drink, he fell violently ill from the quantity of liquor he
                     had consumed.</p>

                  <p>Now he had an oracle the gods had given him that he should die when he had
                     conquered "his betters," but he interpreted the oracle as referring to the
                     Carthaginians, assuming that these were "his betters." So in the wars that he
                     had many times waged against them he was accustomed to withdraw in the hour of
                     victory and accept defeat willingly, in order that he might not appear to have
                     proved himself "better" than the stronger foe.</p>

                     though judged on this occasion in a competition at Athens, he defeated "better"
                     poets than himself. So in verbal consistency with the decree of the oracle he
                     met his death as a direct consequence of defeating "his betters." </p>

                     strange new outbreaks of revolution. For instance, the Arcadian exiles, setting

                     highest standing amongst his fellow countrymen, harangued his fellow citizens
                     at a meeting of the assembly, urging them to strive for the supremacy on the
                     sea. In the course of the speech, which was the result of long consideration,
                     he pointed out that this attempt was both expedient and possible, alleging in
                     particular that it was easy for those who possessed supremacy on land to
                     acquire the mastery of the sea. The Athenians, for instance, in the war with
                     Xerxes, who had two hundred ships manned by themselves, were subject to the
                     commands of the Lacedaemonians who provided only ten ships. By this and many
                     other arguments suited to his theme he prevailed upon the Thebans to make a bid

                     Chios, and Byzantium to assist their schemes. Epameinondas himself, who had
                     been dispatched with a force to the aforementioned cities, so overawed Laches,
                     the Athenian general, who had a large fleet and had been sent out to circumvent

                     country in the battle of Mantineia, he died a hero's death, straightway the

                     into slavery, and to raze the city. For from earliest times the Thebans had
                     been ill-disposed towards them, having paid tribute to the Minyae in the heroic
                     age, but later they had been liberated by the Heracles.</p>

                     speedily to assist as requested; but as Pelopidas was hastening to leave with
                     his army, the sun, as it happened, was eclipsed.</p>

                     strewed all the ground about him with dead men, and though he brought the
                     contest to a close, routed the enemy and won the victory, he yet lost his own

                  <p>These people practised from boyhood assiduously this type of fighting and

                     experience in handling these missiles. Consequently the Athenians, who were
                     continually being wounded by the light-armed and were harried to exhaustion by
                     the opponents who confronted them, all turned and fled.</p>

                     even in their retreat they did not break their own phalanx, and encountering
                     simultaneously the Euboeans and certain mercenaries who had been dispatched to
                     seize the heights near by, they gave battle and slew them all.</p>

                     phalanx opposing them, strove zealously to outflank the infantry. The battle
                     was a hot one; the Athenians were exhausted and had turned to flee, when the
                     Eleian cavalry-commander, assigned to the rear, came to the aid of the
                     fugitives and, by striking down many Boeotians, reversed the course of the

                     cavalry forces lashed at one another and the battle hung for a short time in
                     the balance, but then, because of the number and valour of the Boeotian and
                     Thessalian horsemen, the contingents on the Mantineian side were forced back,
                     and with considerable loss took refuge with their own phalanx. </p>

                     closed with the enemy in hand-to‑hand combat, a mighty, stupendous struggle
                     ensued. For never at any other time when Greeks fought Greeks was such a
                     multitude of men arrayed, nor did generals of greater repute or men more

                     lives to every risk. After the first exchange of spears in which most were
                     shattered by the very density of the missiles, they engaged with swords. And
                     although their bodies were all locked with one another and they were inflicting
                     all manner of wounds, yet they did not leave off; and for a long time as they
                     persisted in their terrible work, because of the superlative courage displayed

                     favour of either side, Epameinondas, conceiving that victory called for the
                     display of his own valour also, decided to be himself the instrument to decide
                     the issue. So he immediately took his best men, grouped them in close formation
                     and charged into the midst of the enemy; he led his battalion in the charge and
                     was the first to hurl his javelin, and hit the commander of the Lacedaemonians.
                     Then, as the rest of his men also came immediately into close quarters with the
                     foe, he slew some, threw others into a panic, and broke through the enemy

                     kept pressing the attack and continually slaying any men who were in the rear

                     battle was pressing forward too eagerly, they charged him in a body. As
                     missiles flew thick and fast about him, he dodged some, others he fended off,
                     still others he pulled from his body and used to ward off his attackers. But
                     while struggling heroically for the victory, he received a mortal wound in the
                     chest. As the spear broke and the iron point was left in his body, he fell of a
                     sudden, his strength sapped by the wound. About his body a rivalry ensued in
                     which many were slain on both sides, but at last with difficulty by their
                     superiority in bodily strength, the Thebans wore the Lacedaemonians out.</p>

                  <p>As the latter turned and fled, the Boeotians pursued for a short time but
                     turned back, considering it most essential to take possession of the bodies of
                     the dead. So, when the trumpeters sounded recall for their men, all withdrew
                     from battle and both sides set up trophies claiming the victory.</p>

                     because they had overpowered the Lacedaemonians and were in possession of the

                     were the first to have sent a herald to ask for the recovery of their dead,

                     the spear-point should be drawn from his chest, death would ensue, with supreme

                     said, "It is time to die," and directed them to withdraw the spear point. His
                     friends press cried out in protest, and one of them said: "You die childless,

                     Agesilaüs the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still
                     earlier than these, in the times of the Medes ands Persians, there were Solon,

                     particular superiority as a claim to fame; in him, however, all qualities
                     combined. For in strength of body and eloquence of speech, furthermore in
                     elevation of mind, contempt of lucre, fairness, and, most of all, in courage

                     at night and rode off with the cavalry to the enemy, having the day before made

                  <p>Datames then summoned his mercenaries, promised them largess, and launched an
                     attack upon the deserters. Finding them on the point of joining forces with the
                     enemy and himself attacking at the same time Artabazus' guard and the horsemen,
                     he slew all who came to close quarters. Artabazus, at first unaware of the
                     truth and suspecting that the man who had deserted Datames was effecting a
                     counter-betrayal, ordered his own men to slay all the horsemen who approached.
                     And Mithrobarzanes, caught between the two parties one group seeking revenge
                     against him as a traitor; the other trying to punish him for counter-betrayal —
                     was in a predicament, but since the situation allowed no time to deliberate, he
                     had recourse to force, and fighting against both parties caused grievous
                     slaughter. When, finally, more than ten thousand had been slain, Datames,
                     having put the rest of Mithrobarzanes' men to flight and slain many of them,
                     recalled with the trumpet his soldiers who had gone in pursuit.</p>

                     was terrified and lacked the courage to risk a battle, bade him take heart.
                     "For," said he, "it is not those who have the advantage of numbers who win the
                     victory, but those who excel in valour." But since the king paid no heed to
                     Agesilaüs, he was obliged to withdraw with him to a large city.</p>

                     surround the city with a wall and a ditch. As the work was rapidly nearing
                     completion by reason of the large number of workers, and the provisions in the
                     city were exhausted, Tachôs despaired of his safety, but Agesilaüs, encouraging

                     numbers, and would utterly destroy them, but Agesilaüs seized a position which
                     had on each side a canal fed by the river and thus halted the enemy's

                     gifts. On his journey back to his native land by way of Cyrenê Agesilaüs died,

                     renewed the war. In the covenant it was written that each should return to his
                     respective native country after the battle, but there had come into the city of
                     Megalopolis the inhabitants of neighbouring cities who had been moved to new
                     homes and were finding transplantation from their own homes difficult to bear.
                     Consequently when they had returned to the cities which had formerly been

                     Megalopolitans besought the Thebans to fight with them as allies. The Thebans

                     kingdom to be the greatest of the dominions in Europe, and having taken over
                     Macedonia when she was a slave to the Illyrians, made her mistress of many

                     Romans elected as consuls Gnaeus Genucius and Lucius Aemilius. During their
                     term of office Philip, the son of Amyntas and father of Alexander who defeated
                     the Persians in war, succeeded to the Macedonian throne in the following

                     Amyntas, as a hostage, placed him in the care of the Thebans. They in turn
                     entrusted the lad to the father of Epameinondas and directed him both to keep
                     careful watch over his ward and to superintend his upbringing and

                     school, Philip, who was reared along with him, acquired a wide acquaintance
                     with the Pythagorean philosophy. Inasmuch as both students showed natural
                     ability and diligence they proved to be superior in deeds of valour. Of the
                     two, Epameinondas underwent the most rigorous tests and battles, and invested
                     his fatherland almost miraculously with the leadership of Hellas, while Philip,
                     availing himself of the same initial training, achieved no less fame than

                     to the throne and then in similar fashion Perdiccas disposed of him and ruled
                     as king. But when he was defeated in a great battle by the Illyrians and fell
                     in the action, Philip his brother, who had escaped from his detention as a

                     to assemble large armies and prepare for an invasion of Macedonia, while a
                     certain Pausanias, who was related to the royal line of Macedon, was planning
                     with the aid of the Thracian king to join the contest for the throne of
                     Macedon. Similarly, the Athenians too, being hostile to Philip, were
                     endeavouring to restore Argaeus to the throne and had dispatched Mantias as

                     Yet even so, with such fears and dangers threatening them, Philip was not
                     panic-stricken by the magnitude of the expected perils, but, bringing together
                     the Macedonians in a series of assemblies and exhorting them with eloquent
                     speeches to be men, he built up their morale, and, having improved the
                     organization of his forces and equipped the men suitably with weapons of war,

                     wealth and nobility of spirit, gathered together the men who had survived the
                     razing of Naxos by Dionysius. Having settled the hill above Naxos called Tauros
                     and remained there a considerable time, he called it Tauromenium from his
                     "remaining on Tauros." And as the city made quick progress, the inhabitants
                     laid up great wealth, and the city, which had won considerable repute, finally

                     and the other the Athenians, war broke out over all Euboea. A good many close
                     combats and skirmishes occurred in which sometimes the Thebans were superior
                     and sometimes the Athenians carried off the victory. Although no important

                     lasted three years. The Athenians chose Chares and Chabrias as generals and
                     dispatched them with an army. The two generals on sailing into Chios found that
                     allies had arrived to assist the Chians from Byzantium, Rhodes, and Cos, and
                     also from Mausolus, the tyrant of Caria. They then drew up their forces and
                     began to besiege the city both by land and by sea. Now Chares, who commanded
                     the infantry force, advanced against the walls by land and began a struggle
                     with the enemy who poured out on him from the city; but Chabrias, sailing up to
                     the harbour, fought a severe naval engagement and was worsted when his ship was

                     a considerable force. By bringing siege-engines against the walls and launching
                     severe and continuous assaults, he succeeded in breaching a portion of the wall
                     with his battering rams, whereupon, having entered the city through the breach
                     and struck down many of his opponents, he obtained the mastery of the city and

                     Indeed he immediately reduced Pydna, and made an alliance with the Olynthians
                     in the terms of which he agreed to take over for them Potidaea, a city which
                     the Olynthians had set their hearts on possessing. </p>

                  <p>Since the Olynthians inhabited an important city and because of its huge

                     for those who sought to extend their supremacy. For this reason the Athenians
                     and Philip were rivals against one another for the alliance with the

                     Athenian garrison out of the city and, treating it considerately, sent it back
                     to Athens — for he was particularly solicitous toward the people of Athens on
                     account of the importance and repute of their city — but, having sold the
                     inhabitants into slavery, he handed it over to the Olynthians, presenting them

                     name, and then, turning to the gold mines in its territory, which were very
                     scanty and insignificant, he increased their output so much by his improvements
                     that they could bring him a revenue of more than a thousand talents.</p>

                     superior position, for with the gold coins which he struck, which came to be
                     known from name as Philippeioi, he organized a large force of mercenaries, and
                     by using these coins for bribes induced many Greeks to become betrayers of
                     their native lands. But concerning these matters the several events, when

                     slenderer resources than those of any conqueror before his time he succeeded

                     all we have mentioned, had a city which was the largest of the cities of
                     Hellas, and harbours and docks and fortified citadels that were impregnable,

                     but still more important than all these were the pusillanimity of the tyrant
                     and his subjects' hatred of him; for when all these characteristics merged at a
                     single critical moment, they unexpectedly brought to a successful close deeds

                     lies by Cephallenia, with two merchantmen, put in at the harbour of Acragas
                     named Minoa. This had been founded of olden time by Minos, king of the Cretans,
                     on the occasion when, in his search for Daedalus, he had been entertained by
                     Cocalus, king of the Sicanians, but in the period with which we are concerned
                     this city was subject to the Carthaginians, and its governor, named Paralus,
                     who was a friend of Dion, received him enthusiastically.</p>

                  <p>Dion, having unloaded from the merchantman five thousand suits of armour,
                     handed them over to Paralus and requested him to transport them on wagons to
                     Syracuse, while he himself, taking along the mercenaries numbering a thousand,
                     led them against Syracuse. On the march he persuaded the peoples of Acragas,
                     Gela, and some of the Sicanians and Sicels who dwelt in the interior, also the
                     people of Camarina, to join in the liberation of the Syracusans, and then
                     advanced to overthrow the tyrant.</p>

                     Italy and of the Messenians were summoned, and all came in haste with great

                     gave up in despair and gathered mercenaries and those who favoured the cause of

                     restoration of their independence and the dissolution of the entire tyranny.

                     suddenly opened the gates of the citadel on the Island, and issued forth with

                     the mercenaries fell upon the wall with a loud and terrifying outcry, massacred
                     many of the garrison and, getting inside the wall, engaged in a struggle with

                     at first the battle stood equally poised, as the valour of both sides in the
                     fight was equal. Many fell, and not a few were wounded, receiving all the blows
                     in front; for on the one hand those in the front rank courageously met death
                     defending the rest, and those arrayed behind them covering them with their
                     shields as they fell and holding firm in the desperate peril took the most

                     battle line of the mercenaries was suddenly cut off and isolated in the crowd.
                     Many missiles hurled at him fell upon his shield and helmet, but he escaped
                     these owing to the protection of his armour, but receiving a wound on his right

                     remainder of the wall at his leisure, he then called for the embassies, having
                     outmanoeuvred the enemy by encouraging their hopes of peace. When discussion
                     arose concerning the terms of settlement, Dion replied to the ambassadors that
                     only one settlement was possible, namely that Dionysius should resign his
                     position as tyrant and then deign to accept certain privileges. But Dionysius,

                     of what was a very small parcel of land. Accordingly he advised them to treat
                     the fines as null and void and declared that the Phocians had strong grounds
                     for their case against the Amphictyons: for in ancient times they had held
                     control and guardianship of the oracle. As witness he offered the most ancient
                     and greatest of all poets, Homer who said: </p>
                  <l>"Now over Phocians Schedius ruled and e'en Epistrophus,</l>
                  <l>They dwelt in Cyparissus and in Pytho land of rocks."</l>

                  <p>On this account he said they should enter a claim for the guardianship of the
                     oracle on the ground that this belonged to the Phocians as an inheritance from
                     their fathers. He promised that he would succeed with the enterprise if they
                     would appoint him general with absolute power for the entire programme and give
                     him complete authority. </p>

                  <p> When the Phocians out of fear of the judgement elected him general with
                     absolute power, Philomelus set about energetically to fulfil his promise. First
                     he went to Sparta, where he conversed in private with Archidamus king of the
                     Lacedaemonians, representing that the king had an equal interest in the effort
                     to render null and void the judgements of the Amphictyons, for there existed
                     serious and unjust pronouncements of that Council to the injury of the
                     Lacedaemonians also.</p>

               <div

                  <p>He accordingly disclosed to Archidamus that he had decided to seize Delphi and
                     that if he succeeded in obtaining the guardianship of the shrine he would annul
                     the decrees of the Amphictyons. Although Archidamus approved of the proposal,
                     he said he would not for the present give assistance openly, but that he would
                     co‑operate secretly in every respect, providing both money and mercenaries.
                     Philomelus, having received from him fifteen talents and having added at least
                     as much on his own account, hired foreign mercenaries and chose a thousand of
                     the Phocians, whom he called peltasts.</p>

                  <p>Then, after he had gathered a multitude of soldiers and had seized the oracle,
                     he slew the group of Delphians called Thracidae who sought to oppose him and
                     confiscated their possessions; but, observing that the others were
                     terror-stricken, he exhorted them to be of good cheer since no danger would
                     befall them.</p>

                     lived near by, straightway took the field against Philomelus. A battle took
                     place near Delphi and the Locrians, having been defeated with the loss of many
                     of their men, fled to their own territory, and Philomelus, being elated by his
                     victory, hacked from the slabs the pronouncements of the Amphictyons, deleted
                     the letters recording their judgements, and personally caused the report to be
                     circulated that he had resolved not to plunder the oracle nor had he purposed
                     to commit any other lawless deed, but that in support of the ancestral claim to
                     the guardianship and because of his desire to annul the unjust decrees of the
                     Amphictyons, he was vindicating the ancestral laws of the Phocians. </p>

                     on, Philomelus threw a wall about the shrine and began to assemble a large
                     number of mercenaries by raising the pay to half as much grain, and selecting
                     the bravest of the Phocians he enrolled them and quickly had a considerable
                     army; for with no less than five thousand troops he took up a position in
                     defence of Delphi, already a formidable adversary for those who wished to make

                     stronghold. Though he made assaults upon this, he was unable to take it and
                     finally desisted from the siege, but joining battle with the Locrians he lost
                     twenty of his men, and not being able to get possession of their bodies, he
                     asked through a herald the privilege of taking them up. The Locrians, refusing
                     to grant this, gave answer that amongst the Greeks it was the general law that
                     temple-robbers should be cast forth without burial.</p>

                  <p> Philomelus so resented this that he joined battle with the Locrians and,
                     bending every effort, slew some of the enemy, and having got possession of
                     their bodies compelled the Locrians to make an exchange of the dead. As he was
                     master of the open country, he sacked a large portion of Locris and returned to
                     Delphi, having given his soldiers their fill of the spoils of war. After this,
                     since he wished to consult the oracle for the war, he compelled the Pythian
                     priestess to mount her tripod and deliver the oracle. </p>

                  <p> Since I have mentioned the tripod, I think it not inopportune to recount the
                     ancient story which has been handed down about it. It is said that in ancient
                     times goats discovered the oracular shrine, on which account even to this day
                     the Delphians use goats preferably when they consult the oracle.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="2">
                  <p>They say that the manner of its discovery was the following. There is a chasm
                     at this place where now is situated what is known as the "forbidden" sanctuary,
                     and as goats had been wont to feed about this because Delphi had not as yet
                     been settled, invariably any goat that approached the chasm and peered into it
                     would leap about in an extraordinary fashion and utter a sound quite different
                     from what it was formerly wont to emit.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p>The herdsman in charge of the goats marvelled at the strange phenomenon and
                     having approached had the same experience as the goats, for the goats began to
                     act like beings possessed and the goatherd began to foretell future events.
                     After this as the report was bruited among the people of the vicinity
                     concerning the experience of those who approached the chasm, an increasing
                     number of persons visited the place and, as they all tested it because of its
                     miraculous character, whosoever approached to spot became inspired. For these
                     reasons the oracle came to be regarded as a marvel and to be considered the
                     prophecy-giving shrine of Earth.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p>For some time all who wished to obtain a prophecy approached the chasm and made
                     their prophetic replies to one another; but later, since many were leaping down
                     into the chasm under the influence of their frenzy and all disappeared, it
                     seemed best to the dwellers in that region, in order to eliminate the risk, to
                     station one woman there as a single prophetess for all and to have the oracles
                     told through her. And for her a contrivance was devised which she could safely
                     mount, then become inspired and give prophecies to those who so desired.</p>

                  <p>And this contrivance has three supports and hence was called a tripod, and, I
                     dare say, all the bronze tripods which are constructed even to this day are
                     made in imitation of this contrivance. In what manner, then, the oracle was
                     discovered and for what reasons the tripod was devised I think I have told at
                     sufficient length.</p>

                  <p>It is said that in ancient times virgins delivered the oracles because virgins
                     have their natural innocence intact and are in the same case as Artemis; for
                     indeed virgins were alleged to be well suited to guard the secrecy of
                     disclosures made by oracles. In more recent times, however, people say that
                     Echecrates the Thessalian, having arrived at the shrine and beheld the virgin
                     who uttered the oracle, became enamoured of her because of her beauty, carried
                     her away with him and violated her; and that the Delphians because of this
                     deplorable occurrence passed a law that in future a virgin should no longer
                     prophesy but that an elderly woman of fifty should declare the oracles and that
                     she should be dressed in the costume of a virgin, as a sort of reminder of the
                     prophetess of olden times. </p>
                  <p> Such are the details of the legend regarding the discovery of the oracle; and
                     now we shall turn to the activities of olden times. </p>

                  <p> When Philomelus had control of the oracle he directed the Pythia to make her
                     prophecies from the tripod in the ancestral fashion. But when she replied that
                     such was not the ancestral fashion, he threatened her harshly and compelled her
                     to mount the tripod. Then when she frankly declared, referring to the superior
                     power of the man who was resorting to violence: "It is in your power to do as
                     you please," he gladly accepted her utterance and declared that he had the
                     oracle which suited him. He immediately had the oracle inscribed and set it up
                     in full view, and made it clear to everyone that the god gave him the authority
                     to do as he pleased.</p>

                     came to him an omen as well, in the temple of Apollo, namely an eagle which,
                     after flying over the temple of the god and swooping down to earth, preyed upon
                     the pigeons which were maintained in the temple precincts, some of which it
                     snatched away from the very altars. Those versed in such matters declared that
                     the omen indicated to Philomelus and the Phocians that they would control the

                     cities of the Greek world, explaining that he had seized Delphi, not with any
                     designs upon its sacred properties but to assert a claim to the guardianship of
                     the sanctuary; for this guardianship had been ordained in early times as

                  <p>In the Leuctrian War the Thebans, after defeating the enemy, brought suit
                     before the Amphictyons against the Spartans, the charge being that Phoebidas
                     the Spartan had seized the Cadmeia, and the Amphictyons assessed a fine of five
                     hundred talents for the offence. Then when the Lacedaemonians had had judgement
                     entered against them and failed to pay the fine during the period set by the
                     laws, the Thebans again brought suit, this time for double damages. </p>

                     similar to those of the Phocians, saying that an unjust judgement had been
                     rendered against them by the Amphictyons.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore, though their interests were now common, the Lacedaemonians hesitated
                     to begin war by themselves on account of the adverse judgement, but thought
                     that it was more seemly to annul the judgements of the Amphictyons through the
                     agency of the Phocians. For these particular reasons they were very ready to
                     fight on the side of the Phocians and they co‑operated in securing for them the

                     against the Phocians, Philomelus decided to gather a great number of
                     mercenaries. Since the war required ampler funds he was compelled to lay his
                     hands on the sacred dedications and to plunder the oracle. By setting the base
                     pay for the mercenaries at half as much again as was usual he quickly assembled
                     a large number of mercenaries, since many answered the summons to the campaign
                     on account of the size of the pay.</p>

                     because of their own greed, eagerly gathered about Philomelus and quickly a

                     with soldiers both foot and horse amounting to more than ten thousand. When the
                     Locrians marshalled their forces to meet him and the Boeotians came to the

                     then, when, bending every effort, they had taken captive many men who were
                     straggling up and down the countryside where the enemy were, they brought them
                     back and all these Philomelus shot. Through this punishment they forced the

                     for himself than peace, he quite logically urged the Phocians and their allies

                     was remodelling with his own hands the bronze statue which the Amphictyons had
                     dedicated in the temple of Apollo, making it much taller and larger. He

                     would be an increase of glory because of his services as general. But truth
                     turned out to be otherwise, rather the contrary was indicated because of the
                     fact that the Amphictyons had dedicated the statue out of the fines paid by the

                     when he had been chosen general in supreme command, prepared a great supply of
                     weapons from the bronze and iron, and having struck coinage from the silver and
                     gold distributed it among the allied cities and chiefly gave it as bribes to

                     He easily accomplished everything because of man's greed. In fact he persuaded
                     even the Thessalians, who were held in highest esteem amongst the allies, by
                     bribes to maintain the peace. In his dealings with the Phocians he also
                     arrested and executed those who opposed him and confiscated their property.
                     After invading the territory of the enemy he took Thronion by storm and reduced

                     company with the Thessalians joined battle against the Phocians, Onomarchus
                     with his superior numbers defeated him in two battles and slew many of the
                     Macedonians. As for Philip, he was reduced to the uttermost perils and his
                     soldiers were so despondent that they had deserted him, but by arousing the
                     courage of the majority, he got them with great difficulty to obey his
                     orders.</p>

                  <p>Later Philip withdrew to Macedonia, and Onomarchus, marching into Boeotia,
                     defeated the Boeotians in battle and took the city of Coroneia. As for
                     Thessaly, however, Philip had just at that time returned with his army from
                     Macedonia and had taken the field against Lycophron, tyrant of Pherae.</p>

                  <p>Lycophron, however, since he was no match for him in strength, summoned
                     reinforcements from his allies the Phocians, promising jointly with them to
                     organize the government of all Thessaly. So when Onomarchus in haste came to
                     his support with twenty thousand foot and five hundred horse, Philip, having
                     persuaded the Thessalians to prosecute the war in common, gathered them all
                     together, numbering more than twenty thousand foot and three thousand
                     horse.</p>

                  <p>A severe battle took place and since the Thessalian cavalry were superior in

                     Chares the Athenian was by chance sailing by with many triremes, a great
                     slaughter of the Phocians took place, for the men in their effort to escape
                     would strip off their armour and try to swim out to the triremes, and among

                     belong. We recall that, when the Egyptians revolted from the Persians in the
                     earlier period, Artaxerxes, known as Ochus, himself unwarlike, remained
                     inactive, and though he sent out armies and generals many times, failed in his
                     attempts because of the cowardice and inexperience of the leaders.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="5">
                  <p>And so, though regarded with contempt by the Egyptians, he was compelled to be
                     patient because of his own inertia and peace-loving nature. But in the period
                     now under discussion, when the Phoenicians and the kings in Cyprus had imitated
                     the Egyptians and in contemptuous disregard of him made a move to revolt, he
                     became enraged and decided to make war upon the insurgents.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="6">
                  <p>So he rejected the practice of sending out generals, and adopted the plan of
                     carrying out in person the struggles to preserve his kingdom. Wherefore, having
                     made great provision of arms, missiles, food, and forces, he assembled three
                     hundred thousand foot-soldiers, thirty thousand horsemen, three hundred
                     triremes, and five hundred merchantmen and other ships to carry the supplies.

                  <p> He began to make war also on the Phoenicians for the following reasons. In
                     Phoenicia there is an important city called Tripolis, whose name is appropriate
                     to its nature, for there are in it three cities, at a distance of a stade from
                     one another, and the names by which these are called are the city of the
                     Aradians, of the Sidonians, and of the Tyrians. This city enjoys the highest
                     repute amongst the cities of Phoenicia, for there, as it happens, the
                     Phoenicians held their common council and deliberated on matters of supreme
                     importance.</p>

               <div

                  <p>Now since the King's satraps and generals dwelt in the city of the Sidonians
                     and behaved in an outrageous and high-handed fashion toward the Sidonians in
                     ordering things to be done, the victims of this treatment, aggrieved by their
                     insolence, decided to revolt from the Persians.</p>

                     independence, they sent ambassadors to the Egyptian king Nectanebôs, who was an
                     enemy of the Persians, and after persuading him to accept them as allies they
                     began to make preparations for the war.</p>

                     and a multitude of mercenaries gathered, and, besides, arms, missiles, food,
                     and all other materials useful in war were provided with dispatch.</p>

                     burning of the fodder for the horses which had been stored up by the satraps
                     for the war; last of all they arrested such Persians as had committed the acts

                     inheritance from his ancestors, to collect an infantry force and a navy to

                     encampment, they began to besiege the Salaminians by land and also by sea.
                     Since all the island had enjoyed peace for a long time and the territory was
                     wealthy, the soldiers, who had possession of the open country, gathered much

                  <p>When word of their affluence got abroad, many soldiers from the opposite coast
                     of Syria and Cilicia flocked over voluntarily in the hope of gain. Finally,
                     after the army with Evagoras and Phocion had been doubled in size, the kings
                     throughout Cyprus fell into a state of great anxiety and terror. </p>

                     marched with his army against Phoenicia. The ruler of Sidon, Tennes, who was
                     informed of the great size of the Persian army and thought that the insurgents
                     were incapable of fighting against it, decided to provide for his personal

                  <p>Accordingly, without the knowledge of the people of Sidon, he sent the most
                     faithful of his own henchmen, Thettalion, to Artaxerxes with the promise that
                     he would betray Sidon to him, would assist him in vanquishing Egypt, and would
                     render him great service, since he was acquainted with the topography of Egypt
                     and knew accurately the landing-places along the Nile.</p>

                  <p> The King on hearing from Thettalion these particulars was extremely pleased
                     and said that he would free Tennes of the charges relative to the revolt, and
                     he promised to give him rich rewards if he performed all that he had agreed
                     upon. But when Thettalion added that Tennes wished him also to confirm his
                     promise by giving his right hand, thereupon the King, flying into a rage at the
                     thought that he was not trusted, handed Thettalion over to his attendants and
                     gave orders to take off his head.</p>

                  <p>But when, as Thettalion was being led off to his punishment, he simply said:
                     "You, O King, will do as you please, but Tennes, though he is able to achieve
                     complete success, since you refuse the pledge, will assuredly not perform any
                     of his promises," the King, hearing what he said, again changed his mind and
                     recalling the attendants directed them to release Thettalion, and then he gave
                     him his right hand, which is the surest pledge amongst the Persians. Thettalion
                     accordingly returned to Sidon and reported what had happened to Tennes without
                     the knowledge of the people of Sidon. </p>

                     Greece requesting them to join the Persians in the campaign against the
                     Egyptians. Now the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians replied that they continued

                     become responsible for Bagoas' life, he made an agreement with him for common

                     command. Three generals having been chosen to replace him, Democrates, Callias,
                     and Sophanes, an investigation into the sacred property took place and the
                     Phocians called upon those who had administered it to render an accounting. The
                     man who had been in charge of most of it was Philon.</p>

                     the theft, while he himself, after being subjected to the utmost torments,
                     obtained the kind of death that suited his impiety.</p>

                     sums acquired by Alexander in the treasure chambers of the Persians. The
                     generals on the staff of Phalaecus took steps even to dig up the temple,
                     because some one said that there was a treasure chamber in it containing much
                     gold and silver, and they zealously dug up the ground about the hearth and
                     tripod. The man who gave information about the treasure offered as witness the
                     most famous and ancient of poets Homer, who says in a certain passage: </p>
                  <q>

                     occurred and roused fear in the hearts of the Phocians, and since the gods
                     clearly indicated in advance the punishment they would visit upon the
                     temple-robbers, the soldiers desisted from their efforts. The leader of this
                     sacrilege, the aforementioned Philon, was promptly punished as he deserved for

                     Iphicrates was tarrying near Corcyra with a naval force and Dionysius the
                     tyrant of Syracuse had shipped to Olympia and to Delphi statues cunningly

                     were conveying these statues, seized them and sent word to the Athenian people
                     inquiring what he should do with them; whereat the Athenians instructed him not
                     to raise questions about what concerned the gods but to give his attention to
                     seeing that his soldiers were well fed.</p>

                     art belonging to the gods. The tyrant, filled with rage at the Athenians, wrote
                     them a letter of the following tenor: </p>
                  <p> "Dionysius to the Senate and Assembly of the Athenians: It is inappropriate to
                     wish you to do well since you are committing sacrilege against the gods both on
                     land and on sea, and, having made off with the statues which had been sent by
                     us to be dedicated to the gods, you have turned them into coin and have
                     committed impiety toward the greatest of the gods, Apollo, whose abode is
                     Delphi, and Olympian Zeus." </p>

                  <p>Such now was the conduct of the Athenians toward the divine powers, and that
                     too though they boasted that Apollo was their tutelary god and progenitor. And
                     the Lacedaemonians, though they had consulted the oracle of Apollo at Delphi
                     and through it come to possess their constitution which is admired of all the
                     world, though even now they still interrogate the god on matters of supreme
                     importance, had the effrontery to become partners in crime of those who had
                     pillaged the sanctuary. </p>

                     Some of the Phocians straightway fled to the nearest cities and dispersed,

                     taken refuge in the temple supposed that their lives would be saved through the
                     intervention of the gods, but on the contrary through some divine Providence
                     they met with the punishment temple-robbers well deserve.</p>

                     behind in the tents of the men who had fled, with the result that the rushes
                     caught fire and such a great conflagration was touched off so miraculously that
                     the temple was consumed and the Phocians who had fled to it for refuge were
                     burned alive. Indeed it became apparent that the gods do not extend to

                     Boeotians and the Phocians were utterly dejected by the length of the war, the
                     Phocians dispatched envoys to Lacedaemon asking for reinforcements, and the

                     pieces in a battle in Thessaly, along with the Phocians and mercenaries of his
                     command, and crucified.</p>

                  <p> Shortly before this, the Carthaginians on their part had come to see that
                     there would be a serious war in Sicily and began making friendly
                     representations to the cities in the island which were their allies. Renouncing
                     their opposition to the tyrants throughout the island, they established
                     friendship with them, and particularly they addressed themselves to Hicetas,
                     the most powerful of these, because he had the Syracusans under his

                     were hostile to the Carthaginians. Of these, none responded except the city of
                     Galeria. These people sent them a thousand hoplites, but the Phoenicians
                     intercepted them, overwhelmed them with a large force, and cut them all

                     Fortune, however, did not neglect the safety of those in danger but brought
                     them an unexpected deliverance. Philip's growth to power had been reported in
                     Asia, and the Persian king, viewing this power with alarm, wrote to his satraps

                     materials required for operations. </p>

                     and assail with scaling ladders the portions of the walls which he had cleared.

                     defeated, for they blocked up the alley-ways and utilized the lowest tier of

                  <p> So, having established peaceful conditions everywhere throughout Sicily, he
                     caused the cities to experience a vast growth of prosperity. For many years,
                     because of domestic troubles and border wars, and still more because of the
                     numbers of tyrants who kept constantly appearing, the cities had become
                     destitute of inhabitants and the open country had become a wilderness for lack
                     of cultivation, producing no useful crops. But now new settlers streamed into
                     the land in great numbers, and as a long period of peace set in, the fields
                     were reclaimed for cultivation and bore abundant crops of all sorts. These the
                     Siceliot Greeks sold to merchants at good prices and rapidly increased their

                  <p>It was by reason of the funds so acquired that many large constructions were
                     completed in that period. There was, first, the structure in Syracuse on the
                     Island called the "Hall of the Sixty Couches," which surpassed all the other
                     buildings of Sicily in size and grandeur. This was built by Agathocles the
                     despot, and since, in its pretentiousness, it went beyond the temples of the
                     gods, so it received a mark of Heaven's displeasure in being struck by
                     lightning. Then there were the towers along the shore of the Little Harbour
                     with their mosaic inscriptions of varicoloured stones, proclaiming the name of
                     their founder, Agathocles. Comparable to these but a little later, in the time
                     of Hiero the king, there was built the Olympieium in the market and the altar
                     beside the theatre, a stade in length and proportionally high and broad. </p>

                     increase of settlers due to this agricultural prosperity, it built the finest
                     theatre in Sicily after that of Syracuse, together with temples of the gods, a
                     council chamber, and a market. There were also memorable towers, as well as

                     Boeotians to join them to make a struggle for freedom. There was no time to

                     two days the king could be expected to enter Attica. As his way led through
                     Boeotia, the support of the Boeotians was their only recourse, especially since
                     Philip was at that time the friend and ally of the Boeotians and would

                     and advanced with forced marches as far as Chaeroneia in Boeotia. Impressed by
                     the promptness of the Athenian arrival and themselves no less ready to act
                     decisively, the Boeotians joined them with their weapons and, brigaded
                     together, all awaited the approach of the enemy.</p>

                  <p>Philip's first move was to send envoys to the Boeotian League, the most eminent
                     of whom was Pytho. He was celebrated for his eloquence, but judged by the
                     Boeotians in this contest for their allegiance against Demosthenes, he
                     surpassed all the other speakers, to be sure, but was clearly inferior to
                     him.</p>
               </div>
               <div

                  <p>And Demosthenes himself in his speeches parades his success against this orator
                     as a great accomplishment, where he says: "I did not then give ground before
                     Pytho in spite of his confidence and his torrent of words against you." </p>

               <div
                  n="5">
                  <p>So Philip failed to get the support of the Boeotians, but nevertheless decided
                     to fight both of the allies together. He waited for the last of his laggard
                     confederates to arrive, and then marched into Boeotia. His forces came to more
                     than thirty thousand infantry and no less than two thousand cavalry.</p>

                     Timotheüs too — and the best of those who were left, Chares, was no better than

                     Once joined, the battle was hotly contested for a long time and many fell on

                     solid front of the enemy line and striking down many he bore heavily on the
                     troops opposite him. As the same success was won by his companions, gaps in the

                     forced back the troops stationed before him and then by compelling them to flee

                     the victory paraded through the midst of his captives, jeering all the time at
                     the misfortunes of the luckless men. Now Demades, the orator, who was then one
                     of the captives, spoke out boldly and made a remark able to curb the king's

                     well-aimed shaft of rebuke, Philip altered his whole demeanour completely. He
                     cast off his garland, brushed aside the symbols of pride that marked the
                     communicates, expressed admiration for the man who dared to speak so plainly,

                     would be delivered up. The casual phrase seemed like an omen sent by Providence
                     to let Philip know that a plot was coming.</p>

                  <p>There were other like words also spoken, seemingly divinely inspired, which
                     forecast the king's death. </p>
                  <p> At the state banquet, Philip ordered the actor Neoptolemus, matchless in the
                     power of his voice and in his popularity, to present some well-received pieces,
                     particularly such as bore on the Persian campaign. The artist thought that his
                     piece would be taken as appropriate to Philip's crossing and intended to rebuke
                     the wealth of the Persian king, great and famous as it was, (suggesting) that
                     it could some day be overturned by fortune. Here are the words that he first
                     sang: </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>"Your thoughts reach higher than the air;</l>
                     <l>You dream of wide fields' cultivation.</l>
                     <l>The homes you plan surpass the homes</l>
                     <l>That men have known, but you do err,</l>
                     <l>Guiding your life afar.</l>
                     <l>But one there is who'll catch the swift,</l>
                     <l>Who goes a way obscured in gloom,</l>
                     <l>And sudden, unseen, overtakes</l>
                     <l>And robs us of our distant hopes —</l>
                     <l>Death, mortals' source of many woes."</l></q>
                  <p> He continued with the rest of the song, all of it dealing with the same
                     theme.</p>

               <div

                  <p>Philip was enchanted with the message and was completely occupied with the
                     thought of the overthrow of the Persian king, for he remembered the Pythian
                     oracle which bore the same meaning as the words quoted by the tragic actor.

                  <p>Finally the drinking was over and the start of the games set for the following
                     day. While it was still dark, the multitude of spectators hastened into the
                     theatre and at sunrise the parade formed. Along with lavish display of every
                     sort, Philip included in the procession statues of the twelve gods wrought with
                     great artistry and adorned with a dazzling show of wealth to strike awe in the
                     beholder, and along with these was conducted a thirteenth statue, suitable for
                     a god, that of Philip himself, so that the king exhibited himself enthroned
                     among the twelve gods. </p>

                     only at a distance, since he wanted to show publicly that he was protected by
                     the goodwill of all the Greeks, and had no need of a guard of spearmen.</p>

                  <p> Such was the pinnacle of success that he had attained, but as the praises and
                     congratulations of all rang in his ears, suddenly without warning the plot
                     against the king was revealed as death struck.</p>

                  <p>We shall set forth the reasons for this in order that our story may be clear. </p>
                  <p> There was a Macedonian Pausanias who came of a family from the district
                     Orestis. He was a bodyguard of the king and was beloved of him because of his
                     beauty.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p>When he saw that the king was becoming enamoured of another Pausanias (a man of
                     the same name as himself), he addressed him with abusive language, accusing him
                     of being a hermaphrodite and prompt to accept the amorous advances of any who
                     wished.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="5">
                  <p>Unable to endure such an insult, the other kept silent for the time, but, after
                     confiding to Attalus, one of his friends, what he proposed to do, he brought
                     about his own death voluntarily and in a spectacular fashion.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="6">
                  <p>For a few days after this, as Philip was engaged in battle with Pleurias, king
                     of the Illyrians, Pausanias stepped in front of him and, receiving on his body
                     all the blows directed at the king, so met his death. </p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="7">
                  <p>The incident was widely discussed and Attalus, who was a member of the court
                     circle and influential with the king, invited the first Pausanias to dinner and
                     when he had plied him till drunk with unmixed wine, handed his unconscious body
                     over to the muleteers to abuse in drunken licentiousness.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="8">
                  <p>So he presently recovered from his drunken stupor and, deeply resenting the
                     outrage to his person, charged Attalus before the king with the outrage. Philip
                     shared his anger at the barbarity of the act but did not wish to punish Attalus
                     at that time because of their relationship, and because Attalus's services were
                     needed urgently.</p>

                  <p>He was the nephew of the Cleopatra whom the king had just married as a new wife
                     and he had been selected as a general of the advanced force being sent into
                     Asia, for he was a man valiant in battle. For these reasons, the king tried to
                     mollify the righteous anger of Pausanias at his treatment, giving him
                     substantial presents and advancing him in honour among his bodyguards. </p>

               <div
                  n="1">
                  <p> Pausanias, nevertheless, nursed his wrath implacably, and yearned to avenge
                     himself, not only on the one who had done him wrong, but also on the one who
                     failed to avenge him. In this design he was encouraged especially by the
                     sophist Hermocrates. He was his pupil, and when he asked in the course of his
                     instruction how one might become most famous, the sophist replied that it would
                     be by killing the one who had accomplished most, for just as long as he was
                     remembered, so long his slayer would be remembered also. Pausanias connected
                     this saying with his private resentment, and admitting no delay in his plans
                     because of his grievance he determined to act under cover of the festival in
                     the following manner.</p>

                  <p>He posted horses at the gates of the city and came to the entrance of the
                     theatre carrying a Celtic dagger under his cloak.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p>When Philip directed his attending friends to precede him into the theatre,
                     while the guards kept their distance, he saw that the king was left alone,
                     rushed at him, pierced him through his ribs, and stretched him out dead; then
                     ran for the gates and the horses which he had prepared for his flight.</p>
               </div>
               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p>Immediately one group of the bodyguards hurried to the body of the king while
                     the rest poured out in pursuit of the assassin; among these last were Leonnatus
                     and Perdiccas and Attalus. Having a good start, Pausanias would have mounted
                     his horse before they could catch him had he not caught his boot in a vine and
                     fallen. As he was scrambling to his feet, Perdiccas and the rest came up with
                     him and killed him with their javelins. </p>

                     throned companion of the twelve gods. He had ruled twenty-four years.</p>

                     while the growth of his position was not due so much to his prowess in arms as

                     death as well as contemporary events in the known parts of the world. This is
                     the best method, I think, of ensuring that events will be remembered, for thus

                     any of the accomplishments of this king; his deeds reported one by one will

                     but first he promptly won over the Macedonians to his support by tactful
                     statements. He declared that the king was changed only in name and that the
                     state would be run on principles no less effective than those of his father's
                     administration. Then he addressed himself to the embassies which were present
                     and in affable fashion bade the Greeks maintain towards him the loyalty which
                     they had shown to his father.</p>

                  <p> A possible rival for the throne remained in Attalus, who was the brother of
                     Cleopatra, the last wife of Philip, and Alexander determined to kill him. As a

                     to do favours and his easy bearing with the soldiers. Alexander had good reason
                     to fear that he might challenge his rule, making common cause with those of the
                     Greeks who opposed him,</p>

                  <p> Now that we have described what took place in Greece, we shall shift our

                     Attalus actually had set his hand to revolt and had agreed with the Athenians
                     to undertake joint action against Alexander, but later he changed his mind.
                     Preserving the letter which had been brought to him from Demosthenes, he sent
                     it off to Alexander and tried by expressions of loyalty to remove from himself

                  <p>Hecataeus, however, following the instructions of the king literally, had him
                     killed by treachery, and thereafter the Macedonian forces in Asia were free
                     from any incitement to revolution, Attalus being dead and Parmenion completely
                     devoted to Alexander. </p>

                  <p>As our narrative is now to treat of the kingdom of the Persians, we must go
                     back a little to pick up the thread. While Philip was still king, Ochus ruled
                     the Persians and oppressed his subjects cruelly and harshly. Since his savage
                     disposition made him hated, the chiliarch Bagoas, a eunuch in physical fact but
                     a militant rogue in disposition, killed him by poison administered by a certain
                     physician and placed upon the throne the youngest of his sons, Arses. </p>

               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p>He similarly made away with the brothers of the new king, who were barely of
                     age, in order that the young man might be isolated and tractable to his
                     control. But the young king let it be known that he was offended at Bagoas's
                     previous outrageous behaviour and was prepared to punish the author of these
                     crimes, so Bagoas anticipated his intentions and killed Arses and his children
                     also while he was still in the third year of his reign.</p>

                  <p>The royal house was thus extinguished, and there was no one in the direct line
                     of descent to claim the throne. Instead Bagoas selected a certain Dareius, a
                     member of the court circle, and secured the throne for him. He was the son of
                     Arsanes, and grandson of that Ostanes who was a brother of Artaxerxes, who had
                     been king. </p>

                  <p>As to Bagoas, an odd thing happened to him and one to point a moral. Pursuing
                     his habitual savagery he attempted to remove Dareius by poison. The plan leaked
                     out, however, and the king, calling upon Bagoas, as it were, to drink to him a
                     toast and handing him his own cup compelled him to take his own medicine. </p>

                  <p> Dareius's selection for the throne was based on his known bravery, in which
                     quality he far surpassed the other Persians. Once when King Artaxerxes was
                     campaigning against the Cadusians, one of them with a wide reputation for
                     strength and courage challenged a volunteer among the Persians to fight in
                     single combat with him. No other dared accept, but Dareius alone entered the
                     contest and slew the challenger, being honoured in consequence by the king with
                     rich gifts, while among the Persians he was conceded the first place in
                     prowess,</p>

                  <p>It was because of this prowess that he was thought worthy to take over the
                     kingship. This happened about the same time as Philip died and Alexander became

                     fitted out a large number of ships of war and assembled numerous strong armies,
                     choosing at the same time his best commanders, among whom was Memnon of Rhodes,

                     the Macedonian alliance, the most important of these being Thebes. At this
                     intelligence, the king was roused to return in haste to Macedonia in his
                     anxiety to put an end to the unrest in Greece. </p>

                  <p>The Thebans sought first of all to expel the Macedonian garrison from the

                     They appealed for support from the Athenians also, and when they received from
                     Demosthenes a free gift of weapons, they equipped all of their citizens who

                     king's arrival was now expected, and the Athenians, under the influence of
                     Demosthenes, voted to support the Thebans, but failed to send out their forces,

                     the power of their opponents possessed an obvious and evident superiority.
                     Nevertheless their leaders assembled in council and prepared a resolution about
                     the war; they were unanimous in deciding to fight it out for their political
                     freedom. The measure was passed by the assembly, and with great enthusiasm all
                     were ready to see the thing through. </p>

                     and supposing that a single city would never dare to match forces with such an
                     army.</p>

                  <p>For at that time Alexander had more than thirty thousand infantry and no less

                     who had hardly experienced a single reverse. This was the army on the skill and
                     loyalty of which he relied to overthrow the Persian empire.</p>

                  <p>If the Thebans had yielded to the situation and had asked the Macedonians for

                     pleasure and would have conceded everything they asked, for he was eager to be
                     rid of these disturbances in Greece so that he might without distraction pursue
                     the war with Persia. </p>
                  <p> Finally, however, he realized that he was despised by the Thebans, and so
                     decided to destroy the city utterly and by this act of terror take the heart

                     common to all the Greeks. In response, the Thebans with equal spirit proclaimed
                     from a high tower that anyone who wished to join the Great King and Thebes in
                     freeing the Greeks and destroying the tyrant of Greece should come over to

                     he set to constructing siege engines and to preparing whatever else was

                  <p>Elsewhere in Greece, as people learned the seriousness of the danger hanging
                     over the Thebans, they were distressed at their expected disaster but had no
                     heart to help them, feeling that the city by precipitate and ill-considered

                  <p>In Thebes itself, however, men accepted their risk willingly and with good
                     courage, but they were puzzled by certain sayings of prophets and portents of
                     the gods. </p>
                  <p> First there was the light spider's web in the temple of Demeter which was
                     observed to have spread itself out to the size of an himation, and which all
                     about shone iridescent like a rainbow in the sky.</p>

               <div
                  n="3">
                  <p>About this, the oracle at Delphi gave them the response: </p>
                  <l>"The gods to mortals all have sent this sign;</l>
                  <l>To the Boeotians first, and to their neighbours."</l>
                  <l>The ancestral oracle of Thebes itself had given this response:</l>
                  <l>"The woven web is bane to one, to one a boon."</l>
               </div>
               <div

                  <p>This sign had occurred three months before Alexander's descent on the city, but
                     at the very moment of the king's arrival the statues in the market place were
                     seen to burst into perspiration and be covered with great drops of moisture.
                     More than this, people reported to the city officials that the marsh at
                     Onchestus was emitting a sound very like a bellow, while at Dircê a bloody
                     ripple ran along the surface of the water.</p>

                  <p>Finally, travellers coming from Delphi told how the temple which the Thebans
                     had dedicated from the Phocian spoils was observed to have blood-stains on its
                     roof. </p>
                  <p> Those who made a business of interpreting such portents stated that the spider
                     web signified the departure of the gods from the city, its iridescence meant a
                     storm of mixed troubles, the sweating of the statues was the sign of an
                     overwhelming catastrophe, and the appearance of blood in many places foretold a
                     vast slaughter throughout the city.</p>

               <div

                  <p>They pointed out that the gods were clearly predicting disaster for the city

                     battlefield, but that a safer solution be sought for in conversations. </p>
                  <p> Still the Thebans' spirits were not daunted. On the contrary they were so
                     carried away with enthusiasm that they reminded one another of the victory at
                     Leuctra and of the other battles where their own fighting qualities had won
                     unhoped for victories to the astonishment of the Greek world. They indulged
                     their nobility of spirit bravely rather than wisely, and plunged headlong into
                     the total destruction of their country. </p>

                  <p> Now the king in the course of only three days made everything ready for the
                     assault. He divided his forces into three parts and ordered one to take the
                     palisades which had been erected before the city, the second to face the Theban
                     battle line, and the third as a reserve to support any hard pressed unit of his
                     forces and to enter the battle in its turn.</p>

                     face those who drove at the walls, and themselves made ready to fight before
                     the city with the Macedonian force about the king which was many times their

                  <p> When the Macedonians approached and each division encountered the opposing
                     force of Thebans, the trumpets blew the call to arms and the troops on both
                     sides raised the battle cry in unison and hurled their missiles at the

                  <p> These were soon expended and all turned to the use of the sword at close
                     quarters, and a mighty struggle ensued. The Macedonians exerted a force that
                     could hardly be withstood because of the numbers of their men and the weight of
                     the phalanx, but the Thebans were superior in bodily strength and in their
                     constant training in the gymnasium. Still more, in exaltation of spirit they
                     were lifted out of themselves and became indifferent to personal danger.</p>

                  <p>Many were wounded in both armies and not a few fell facing the blows of the
                     enemy. The air was filled with the roar of fighters locked in the struggle,
                     moans and shouts and exhortations: on the Macedonian side, not to be unworthy
                     of their previous exploits, and on the Theban, not to forget children and wives
                     and parents threatened with slavery and their every household lying exposed to
                     the fury of the Macedonians, and to remember the battles of Leuctra and of
                     Mantineia and the glorious deeds which were household words throughout Greece.
                     So for a long time the battle remained evenly poised because of the surpassing

                     ordered his reserve division to enter the struggle. As this suddenly struck the

                     Macedonians now openly confessed to being their inferiors. Under normal
                     circumstances, when an enemy attacks in relays, it is usual for soldiers to
                     fear the fresh strength of the reinforcements, but the Thebans alone then faced
                     their dangers ever more boldly, as the enemy sent against them new troops for
                     those whose strength flagged with weariness. </p>

                     the Macedonians, stoutly faced the second and still had high hopes of victory.
                     When they knew that a section of the city had been taken, however, they began
                     immediately to withdraw within the walls,</p>

                     into the city in disorder and, encountering a maze of narrow alleys and
                     trenches, lost their footing and fell and were killed by their own weapons. At
                     the same time the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmeia burst out of the citadel,
                     engaged the Thebans, and attacking them in their confusion made a great

                     proclamation, the Macedonians pressed upon them more furiously than is usual in
                     war, and shrieking curses flung themselves on the wretched people, slaying all

                  <p>As the slaughter mounted and every corner of the city was piled high with
                     corpses, no one could have failed to pity the plight of the unfortunates. For
                     even Greeks — Thespians, Plataeans and Orchomenians and some others hostile to
                     the Thebans who had joined the king in the campaign — invaded the city along

                  <p>So it was that many terrible things befell the city. Greeks were mercilessly
                     slain by Greeks, relatives were butchered by their own relatives, and even a
                     common dialect induced no pity. In the end, when night finally intervened, the
                     houses had been plundered and children and women and aged persons who had fled
                     into the temples were torn from sanctuary and subjected to outrage without

                  <p> The king gave burial to the Macedonian dead, more than five hundred in number,
                     and then calling a meeting of the representatives of the Greeks put before the

                     they pointed out that they had taken the side of the barbarians against the
                     Greeks. For in the time of Xerxes they had actually joined forces with the
                     Persians and campaigned against Greece, and alone of the Greeks were honoured
                     as benefactors by the Persian kings, so that the ambassadors of the Thebans
                     were seated on thrones set in front of the kings.</p>

                     sell the captives, to outlaw the Theban exiles from all Greece, and to allow no

                     introduced, and after they had spoken, the people were plunged into deep
                     distress and perplexity. They were anxious to uphold the honour of their city
                     but at the same time they were stunned with horror at the destruction of Thebes
                     and, warned by the calamities of their neighbours, were alarmed in face of

                     would suffer no irremediable disaster, and he inveighed against the
                     faint-heartedness and cowardice of those who would not lay down their lives for
                     their city. The people nevertheless rejected his advice and riotously drove him

                     talents from Demosthenes's supporters, counselled them to save those whose
                     lives were threatened, and read a decree that had been subtly worded. It
                     contained a plea for the men and a promise to impose the penalty prescribed by

                     counsel how to oppose Alexander. Memnon, the Rhodian, famed for his military
                     competence, advocated a policy of not fighting a pitched battle, but of
                     stripping the countryside and through the shortage of supplies preventing the
                     Macedonians from advancing further, while at the same time they sent naval and

                  <p> There are those who say that Alexander's strategic conception was sound, when

                     bound to be a great battle, and he judged that the Macedonians would fight more
                     desperately if he deprived them of all hope of escape by flight.</p>

                     safety, while at the same time the king, now that he had good hostages, would

                     and a great struggle took place, and when Alexander and his staff came up, the
                     Persians, forced back, were confined within the city, and the king through a
                     herald asked for a truce to recover the Macedonians who had fallen in front of
                     the walls. Now Ephialtes and Thrasybulus, Athenians fighting on the Persian
                     side, advised not to give up the dead bodies for burial, but Memnon granted the
                     request. </p>

                  <p> After this at a council of the commanders, Ephialtes advised them not to wait
                     till the city was taken and they found themselves captives; he proposed that
                     the leaders of the mercenaries should go out themselves in the front rank and
                     lead an attack on the enemy.</p>

                     threw all the gates wide open. It was daybreak, and sallying forth with his
                     band he employed the one group to set fire to the siege engines, causing a
                     great conflagration to flame up at once, </p>

                     When the king saw what was happening, he placed the best fighters of the
                     Macedonians in front and he posted a third group also consisting of others who
                     had a good record for stout fighting. He himself at the head of all took
                     command and made a stand against the enemy, who had supposed that because of
                     their mass they would be invincible. He also sent men out to extinguish the
                     fire and to rescue the siege engines. </p>

                     than the rest, slew with his own hand many who traded blows with him. From the
                     top of the recently erected replacement wall, the defenders slew many of the
                     Macedonians with dense showers of missiles — for there had been erected a wood

                     from combat duty by virtue of their age, but who had served with Philip on his

                     inhabited by people named Marmares. As Alexander marched by, these people

                  <p>The king was enraged at this, established a siege, and exerted every effort to

                     strength of their fortifications, and manfully withstood the attack. For two
                     whole days there were constant assaults and it was clear that the king would

                     possible. They would have none of this, however, but all were eager to die
                     together simultaneously with the end of the freedom of their state, so next the
                     elders urged upon them that they should kill with their own hands their
                     children and wives and aged relatives, and those who were strong enough to save
                     themselves should break out through the midst of the enemy at night and take

                     dread event. Some of them, however (these were about six hundred), decided not
                     to kill their relatives with their own hands, but to burn them in the houses,

                     Greeks who were friendly to Persia, notably Sparta, began to have high hopes of

                     Friends and laid before them the alternatives, either to send generals with an

                     became angry and made free with slurs on Persian lack of manliness. This
                     offended the king, and as his wrath blinded him to his advantage, he seized
                     Charidemus by the girdle according to the custom of the Persians, turned him

                     relieved Alexander of the trouble. Making an astonishing recovery, the king

                  <p> The kings, however, were still occupied. When he knew that he was decisively
                     defeated, Dareius gave himself up to flight and mounting in turn one after
                     another of his best horses galloped on at top speed, desperately seeking to
                     escape from Alexander's grasp and anxious to reach the safety of the upper

                     had come back from the pursuit after stripping Dareius of his arms. At this, a
                     great outcry and lamentation arose among the women; and the rest of the
                     captives, joining in their sorrow at the news, sent up a loud wail, so that the
                     king heard it and sent Leonnatus, one of his friends, to quiet the uproar and
                     to reassure Sisyngambris by explaining that Dareius was still alive and that
                     Alexander would show them the proper consideration. In the morning he would
                     come to address them and to demonstrate his kindness by deeds.</p>

                     Hephaestion, and came to the women. They both were dressed alike, but
                     Hephaestion was taller and more handsome. Sisyngambris took him for the king
                     and did him obeisance. As the others present made signs to her and pointed to
                     Alexander with their hands she was embarrassed by her mistake, but made a new

                     of terms he gave the promise of coming benefactions to those who had been
                     wretched a moment before. Assuring Sisyngambris that she would be his second

                     which she had been given by Dareius and added more in addition not less in
                     number than the preceding. He promised to provide for the marriage of the
                     daughters even more generously than Dareius had promised and to bring up the

                     countenance and not frightened at all, he remarked to Hephaestion that at the
                     age of six years the boy showed a courage beyond his years and was much braver
                     than his father. As to the wife of Dareius, he said that he would see that her

                     with her former happiness. </p>

                     He gave them his hand as pledge of all this and was not only showered with
                     praises by those who had been helped, but won universal recognition throughout
                     his own army for his exceeding propriety of conduct. In general I would say
                     that of many good deeds done by Alexander there is none that is greater or more

                     had received, but wrote to Alexander advising him to bear his success as one
                     who was only human and to release the captives in return for a large ransom. He
                     added that he would yield to Alexander the territory and cities of Asia west of

                     great gifts from the king in return for such a favour. They would draw

                     was almost unassailable because it lay four furlongs away from the coast.
                     Nevertheless he determined to run every risk and make every effort to save the

                     the Macedonians were already nearing the entrance, but the Phoenicians, by a
                     narrow margin, escaped losing their whole force and, thrusting their way in,
                     got safely to the city with the loss only of the ships at the tail of the

                     destroyed some of the missiles and deflected other, and broke the force of all.

                     their walls, the Tyrians built a second one at a distance of five cubits within
                     the first; this was ten cubits in thickness, and the passage between the walls

                  <p> By the time he heard of his arrival, Dareius had already assembled his forces
                     from all directions and made everything ready for battle. He had fashioned
                     swords and lances much longer than his earlier types because it was thought
                     Alexander had had a great advantage in this respect in the battle in Cilicia.
                     He had also constructed two hundred scythe-bearing chariots well designed to
                     astonish and terrify the enemy.</p>

                  <p>From each of these there projected out beyond the trace horses scythes three
                     spans long, attached to the yoke, and presenting their cutting edges to the
                     front. At the axle housings there were two more scythes pointing straight out
                     with their cutting edges turned to the front like the others, but longer and
                     broader. Curved blades were fitted to the ends of these. </p>

                     thousand infantry and no less than two hundred thousand cavalry. He kept the
                     Tigris on the right of his route and the Euphrates on the left, and proceeded
                     through a rich country capable of furnishing ample fodder for the animals and
                     food enough for so many soldiers.</p>

                     plains there were well suited to his purpose and afforded ample manoeuvre room
                     for the huge forces at his disposal. Pitching camp at a village named Arbela,
                     he drilled his troops daily and made them well disciplined by continued
                     training and practice. He was most concerned lest some confusion should arise
                     in the battle from the numerous peoples assembled who differed in speech. </p>

                     and also to give him twenty thousand talents of silver, but Alexander would not

                     a friend. He offered him all the territory west of the Euphrates, thirty
                     thousand talents of silver, and the hand of one of his daughters. Alexander
                     would become Dareius's son-in‑law and occupy the place of a son, while sharing

                     preferring glory to the gifts which were extended to him. Then he told the
                     envoys that the earth could not preserve its plan and order if there were two
                     suns nor could the inhabited world remain calm and free from war so long as two

                     the other hand, he despised glory and chose profit and luxury with a life of
                     ease, then let him obey Alexander, but be king over all other rulers, since
                     this privilege was granted him by Alexander's generosity. </p>

                  <p>Dareius heard Alexander's answer and gave up any hope of a diplomatic
                     settlement. He continued drilling his troops each day and brought their battle
                     discipline to a satisfactory state. He sent off one of his Friends, Mazaeus,
                     with a picked body of men to guard the crossing of the river and to seize and
                     hold the ford. Other troops he sent out to scorch the earth over which the
                     enemy must come. He thought of using the bed of the Tigris as a defence against
                     the advance of the Macedonians.</p>

                  <p>Mazaeus, however, looked upon the river as uncrossable because of its depth and

                     forces with those who were burning the countryside, and having wasted a great
                     stretch of it, judged that it would be unusable by the enemy because of the
                     lack of forage. </p>

                  <p>Alexander, nevertheless, when he came to the crossing of the Tigris River,
                     learned of the ford from some of the local natives, and transferred his army to
                     the east bank. This was accomplished not only with difficulty but even at

                  <p>The depth of the water at the ford was above a man's breast and the force of
                     the current swept away many who were crossing and deprived them of their
                     footing, and as the water struck their shields, it bore many off their course
                     and brought them into extreme danger.</p>

                  <p>But Alexander contrived a defence against the violence of the river. He ordered
                     all to lock arms with each other and to construct a sort of bridge out of the
                     compact union of their persons.</p>

                     and led it forward toward the enemy, then pitched camp not far from the

                     the strength of their arms, Alexander lay awake throughout the night occupied
                     with concern for the next day. About the morning watch he fell asleep, and

                     sleep continued to possess him, Parmenion, the senior among the Friends, issued
                     on his own responsibility the order to the troops to make ready for the

                     pressed him to tell the reason for his unconcern, Alexander said that Dareius
                     had freed him from all anxiety by assembling all his forces into one place.

                     sent by their fathers to serve as bodyguards.</p>

                     an outstanding devotion to its commander and obedience to his commands, and to

                     voluntarily, and some have written that he did this in compliance with orders
                     given by Dareius to his trusted officials. The king Persia hoped by this
                     policy, it is suggested, that Alexander would be kept busy with dazzling

                     seated himself upon the royal throne, which was larger than the proportions of
                     his body. When one of the pages saw that his feet were a long way from reaching
                     the footstool which belonged to the throne, he picked up Dareius's table and
                     placed it under the dangling legs.</p>

                     crying?" The eunuch replied, "Now I am your slave as formerly I was the slave
                     of Dareius. I am by nature devoted to my masters and I was grieved at seeing
                     what was most held in honour by your predecessor now become an ignoble piece of

                  <p>This answer reminded the king how great a change had come over the Persian
                     kingdom. He saw that he had committed an act of arrogance quite the reverse of
                     his gentleness to the captives,</p>

                     Philotas, who was present, said, "But this was not insolence, for the action
                     was not commanded by you; it occurred through the providence and design of a
                     good spirit." So the king took this remark for an omen, and ordered the table
                     to be left standing at the foot of the throne. </p>

                     cliffs offered no passage, but an Uxian native who knew the country offered to
                     lead soldiers by a narrow and hazardous path to a position above the enemy.

                     waves. The assault was pressed vigorously and the Persians were preoccupied
                     with the struggle when to their astonishment above their heads appeared the
                     flying column of the Macedonians. The Persians were frightened and took to

                     allowed him to proceed along the pass for some distance, but when he was about
                     half-way through the hard part, they suddenly attacked him and rolled down from
                     above huge boulders, which falling suddenly upon the massed ranks of the
                     Macedonians killed many of them. Many of the enemy threw javelins down from the
                     cliffs into the crowd, and did not miss their mark. Still others coming to
                     close quarters flung stones at the Macedonians who pressed on. The Persians had
                     a tremendous advantage because of the difficulty of the country, killed many

                     were slain and practically all the attacking force were disabled, he recalled

                     through the hills. All insisted that there was no other way through, although
                     it was possible to go around them at the cost of several days' travel. It
                     seemed to Alexander, however, discreditable to abandon his dead and unseemly to
                     ask for them, since this carried with it the acknowledgement of defeat, so he

                     and Thermodon. She was remarkable for beauty and for bodily strength, and was
                     admired by her countrywomen for bravery. She had left the bulk of her army on
                     the frontier of Hyrcania and had arrived with an escort of three hundred

                     this the king was delighted and granted her request and consorted with her for

                     kingdom without contest, and he began to imitate the Persian luxury and the
                     extravagant display of the kings of Asia. First he installed ushers of Asiatic
                     race in his court, and then he ordered the most distinguished persons to act as

                     put to death the soldiers who were left with him, had made common cause with
                     Bessus and with him had decided to attack the Macedonians, so Alexander set out

                     fault with him for some reason, and in a rash fit of anger formed a plot

                     tell him everything. Philotas did the same thing on the next day also, and
                     Cebalinus, to insure himself against someone else betraying the plot and put
                     him in danger, dropped Philotas and accosted one of the royal pages, telling

                     laden with provisions. Saved from utter despair, then, Cyrus gave them
                     exemption from taxation and other marks of honour, and abolishing their former
                     appellation, named them Benefactors.</p>

                     Here the old man camped with his sons, and had come to know the country
                     intimately. When he appeared before the king, he told his story and offered to
                     guide the king through the hills and bring him to a point where he would be

                     had thus enclosed the defenders in a hopeless siege. Then he put many hands to
                     work filling up the chasm at the foot of the rock, drew near to it, and mounted
                     a vigorous attack, assaulting continuously for seven days and seven nights with

                     finished, however, and the dart-throwing catapults and other engines were
                     emplaced, and the king also made it evident that he would not break off the
                     siege, the Indians were alarmed, and Alexander, craftily anticipating what
                     would happen, removed the guard which had been left in the path, allowing those
                     who wished to withdraw from the rock. In fear of the Macedonian fighting
                     qualities and the king's determination, the Indians left the rock under cover

                     enlisted the support of a second king of the neighbouring regions, whose name
                     was Embisarus; he had an army little smaller than that of Porus. </p>

                  <p>As he approached, Porus learned of his advance and deployed his forces
                     promptly. He stationed his cavalry upon both flanks, and arranged his
                     elephants, arrayed so as to strike terror in an opponent, in a single line at
                     equal intervals along his front. Between these beasts he placed the rest of his
                     infantry, with the mission of helping them and preventing their being attacked
                     with javelins from the sides. </p>

                     make good use of their height and strength. Some of the Macedonians were
                     trodden under foot, armour and all, by the beasts and died, their bones
                     crushed. Others were caught up by the elephants' trunks and, lifted on high,
                     were dashed back down to the ground again, dying a fearful death. Many soldiers
                     were pierced through by the tusks and died instantly, run through the whole
                     body. Nevertheless the Macedonians faced the frightening experience

                     which were not yet out of hand, then attacked the enemy with their combined
                     weight and inflicted many losses. He was himself outstanding in bodily strength
                     beyond any of his followers, being five cubits in height and with a breadth of

                  <p>His javelins were flung with such force that they were little inferior to the

                     fighting ability, but Alexander called up the bowmen and other light armed
                     troops and ordered them to concentrate their fire upon Porus. This was done

                     that there was a desert to traverse for twelve days, and then the river called
                     Ganges, which was thirty-two furlongs in width and the deepest of all the
                     Indian rivers. Beyond this in turn dwelt the peoples of the Tabraesians and the
                     Gandaridae, whose king was Xandrames. He had twenty thousand cavalry, two
                     hundred thousand infantry, two thousand chariots, and four thousand elephants
                     equipped for war. Alexander doubted this information and sent for Porus, and

                     handsome and was greatly loved by the queen; when she had murdered her husband,

                     Macedonians, as well as in the oracles which he had received, and expected that
                     he would be victorious. He remembered that the Pythia had called him

                     was necessary to raise their spirits by an effective appeal if they were to

                     in sight. The hooves of the horses had been worn thin by steady marching. The
                     arms and armour were wearing out, and Greek clothing was quite gone. They had
                     to clothe themselves in foreign materials, recutting the garments of the

                     erected altars of the twelve gods each fifty cubits high and then traced the
                     circuit of a camp thrice the size of the existing one. Here he dug a ditch
                     fifty feet wide and forty feet deep, and throwing up the earth on the inside,
                     constructed out of it a substantial wall.</p>

                     long, and the cavalry, in addition to this, to build two mangers twice the
                     normal size. In the same way, everything else which could be left behind was
                     exaggerated in size. His idea in this was to make a camp of heroic proportions
                     and to leave to the natives evidence of men of huge stature, displaying the

                  <p>In the course of the drinking a curious event occurred which is worth mention.
                     Among the king's companions there was a Macedonian named Coragus, strong in
                     body, who had distinguished himself many times in battle. His temper was
                     sharpened by the drink, and he challenged to single combat Dioxippus the
                     Athenian, an athlete who had won a crown in the foremost games.</p>

                  <p>As you would expect, the guests at the banquet egged them on and Dioxippus
                     accepted. The king set a day for the contest, and when the time came, many
                     myriads of men gathered to see the spectacle.</p>

                     the Greeks favoured Dioxippus. The two advanced to the field of honour, the
                     Macedonian clad in his expensive armour</p>

                  <p> Both men were fine to look upon with their magnificent physiques and their
                     ardour for combat. Everyone looked forward, as it were, to a battle of gods. By
                     his carriage and the brilliance of his arms, the Macedonian inspired terror as
                     if he were Ares, while Dioxippus excelled in sheer strength and condition;
                     still more because of his club he bore a certain resemblance to Heracles. </p>
                  <p> As they approached each other, the Macedonian flung his javelin from a proper
                     distance, but the other inclined his body slightly and avoided its impact. Then
                     the Macedonian poised his long lance and charged, but the Greek, when he came
                     within reach, struck the spear with his club and shattered it.</p>

                  <p> After these two defeats, Coragus was reduced to continuing the battle with his
                     sword, but as he reached for it, the other leaped upon him and seized his
                     swordhand with his left, while with his right the Greek upset the Macedonian's
                     balance and made his lose his footing.</p>

                     persuaded one of the butlers to secrete a golden cup under his pillow; then in
                     the course of the next symposium they accused him of theft, and pretending to

                     trick that had been played on him, gave this to his servants to take to the
                     king, and then took his own life. He had been ill-advised to undertake the

                     the body became numb immediately and then sharp pains followed, and convulsions
                     and shivering shook the whole frame. The skin became cold and livid and bile
                     appeared in the vomit, while a black froth was exuded from the wound and

                     his good deeds. The king saw a vision in his sleep. It seemed to him that a
                     snake appeared carrying a plant in its mouth, and showed him its nature and

                  <p>At this time Peucestes arrived with twenty thousand Persian bowmen and
                     slingers. Alexander placed these in units with his other soldiers, and by the
                     novelty of this innovation created a force blended and adjusted to his own

                  <p>Since there were by now sons of the Macedonians born of captive women, he
                     determined the exact number of these. There were about ten thousand, and he set
                     aside for them revenues sufficient to provide them with an upbringing proper
                     for freeborn children, and set over them teachers to give them their proper

                     the third day to the Celones, as they are called. There dwells here down to our
                     time a settlement of Boeotians who were moved in the time of Xerxes's campaign,

                     at the time of Alexander's visit there were counted only sixty thousand. After

                  <p> During this period Greece was the scene of disturbances and revolutionary
                     movements from which arose the war called Lamian. The reason was this. The king
                     had ordered all his satraps to dissolve their armies of mercenaries, and as
                     they obeyed his instructions, all Asia was overrun with soldiers released from
                     service and supporting themselves by plunder. Presently they began assembling

                  <p>Ultimately they chose as supreme commander the Athenian Leosthenes, who was a
                     man of unusually brilliant mind, and thoroughly opposed to the cause of
                     Alexander. He conferred secretly with the council at Athens and was granted
                     fifty talents to pay the troops and a stock of weapons sufficient to meet
                     pressing needs. He sent off an embassy to the Aetolians, who were unfriendly to
                     the king, looking to the establishment of an alliance with them, and otherwise
                     made every preparation for war. </p>

                     seriousness of the proposed conflict, but Alexander launched a campaign with a
                     mobile force against the Cossaeans, for they would not submit to him. This is a
                     people outstanding in valour which occupied the mountains of Media; and relying
                     upon the ruggedness of their country and their ability in war, they had never
                     accepted a foreign master, but had remained unconquered throughout the whole
                     period of the Persian kingdom, and now they were too proudly self-confident to
                     be terrified of the Macedonian arms.</p>

                     engagement, and both slew many of the Cossaeans and captured many times more. </p>
                  <p> So the Cossaeans were utterly defeated, and, distressed at the number of their
                     captives, were constrained to buy their recovery at the price of national

                     to predict future events by a method based on age-long observations, chose from
                     their number the eldest and most experienced. By the configuration of the stars
                     they had learned of the coming death of the king in Babylon, and they
                     instructed their representatives to report to the king the danger which
                     threatened. They told their envoys also to urge upon the king that he must
                     under no circumstances make his entry into the city;</p>

                     pass the city by. </p>
                  <p> The leader of the Chaldaean envoys, whose name was Belephantes, was not bold
                     enough to address the king directly but secured a private audience with
                     Nearchus, one of Alexander's Friends, and told him everything in detail,
                     requesting him to make it known to the king.</p>

                  <p>When Alexander, accordingly, learned from Nearchus about the Chaldaeans'
                     prophecy, he was alarmed and more and more disturbed, the more he reflected
                     upon the ability and high reputation of these people. After some hesitation, he
                     sent most of his Friends into Babylon, but altered his own route so as to avoid
                     the city and set up his headquarters in a camp at a distance of two hundred
                     furlongs. </p>
                  <p> This act caused general astonishment and many of the Greeks came to see him,

                     prophetic arts, and especially that which was held in high regard by the
                     Chaldaeans. It was as if the king had been wounded in his soul and then healed

                  <p> When the embassies had been dismissed, Alexander threw himself into
                     preparations for the burial of Hephaestion. He showed such zeal about the
                     funeral that it not only surpassed all those previously celebrated on earth but
                     also left no possibility for anything greater in later ages. He had loved
                     Hephaestion most of the group of Friends who were thought to have been high in
                     his affections, and after his death showed him superlative honour. In his
                     lifetime, he had preferred him to all, although Craterus had a rival claim to
                     his love;</p>

                     no less than Hephaestion, Alexander had answered that Craterus was king-loving,
                     but Hephaestion was Alexander-loving. At their first meeting with Dareius's
                     mother, when she from ignorance had bowed to Hephaestion supposing him to be
                     the king and was distressed when this was called to her attention, Alexander
                     had said: "Never mind, mother. For actually he too is Alexander." </p>

                  <p>As a matter of fact, Hephaestion enjoyed so much power and freedom of speech
                     based on this friendship that when Olympias was estranged from him because of
                     jealousy and wrote sharp criticisms and threats against him in her letters, he
                     felt strong enough to answer her reproachfully and ended his letter as follows:
                     "Stop quarrelling with us and do not be angry or menacing. If you persist, we
                     shall not be much disturbed. You know that Alexander means more to us than
                     anything." </p>

                  <p>As part of the preparations for the funeral, the king ordered the cities of the
                     region to contribute to its splendour in accordance with their ability, and he
                     proclaimed to all the peoples of Asia that they should sedulously quench what
                     the Persians call the sacred fir, until such time as the funeral should be
                     ended. This was the custom of the Persians when their kings died, and people
                     thought that the order was an ill omen, and that heaven was foretelling the
                     king's own death.</p>

                  <p>In keeping with this magnificence and the other special marks of honour at the
                     funeral, Alexander ended by decreeing that all should sacrifice to Hephaestion
                     as god coadjutor. As a matter of fact, it happened just at this time that
                     Philip, one of the Friends, came bearing a response from Ammon that Hephaestion
                     should be worshipped as a god. Alexander was delighted that the god had
                     ratified his own opinion, was himself the first to perform the sacrifice, and
                     entertained everybody handsomely. The sacrifice consisted of ten thousand

                  <p> After the funeral, the king turned to amusements and festivals, but just when
                     it seemed that he was at the peak of his power and good fortune, Fate cut off
                     the time allowed him by nature to remain alive. Straightway heaven also began
                     to foretell his death, and many strange portents and signs occurred. </p>
                  <p> Once when the king was being rubbed with oil and the royal robe and diadem
                     were lying on a chair, one of the natives who was kept in bonds was
                     spontaneously freed from his fetters, escaped his guards' notice, and passed
                     through the doors of the palace with no one hindering.</p>

                     diadem, then seated himself upon the chair and remained quiet. As soon as the
                     king learned of this, he was terrified at the odd event, but walked to the
                     chair and without showing his agitation asked the man quietly who he was and
                     what he meant by doing this.</p>

                     hoping that the trouble which was forecast by his act might light upon the
                     man's own head. He picked up the clothing and sacrificed to the gods who avert
                     evil, but continued to be seriously troubled. He recalled the prediction of the
                     Chaldaeans and was angry with philosophers who had persuaded him to enter
                     Babylon. He was impressed anew with the skill of the Chaldaeans and their
                     insight, and generally railed at those who used specious reasoning to argue
                     away the power of Fate. </p>

                  <p>A little while later heaven sent him a second portent about his kingship. He
                     had conceived the desire to see the great swamp of Babylonia and set sail with
                     his friends in a number of skiffs. For some days his boat became separated from
                     the others and he was lost and alone, fearing that he might never get out

                     by one of them and then dropped into the swamp. One of the oarsmen swam after
                     it and, wishing to return it safely, placed it on his head and so swam back to

                     anything helpful and Alexander continued in great discomfort and acute
                     suffering. When he, at length, despaired of life, he took off his ring and

                     Friends would stage a vast contest in honour of his funeral.</p>

                     was at variance with the king's mother Olympias. At first he did not take her
                     seriously because Alexander did not heed her complaints against him, but later,
                     as their enmity kept growing and the king showed an anxiety to gratify his
                     mother in everything out of piety, Antipater gave many indications of his
                     disaffection. This was bad enough, but the murder of Parmenion and Philotas
                     struck terror into Antipater as into all of Alexander's Friends, so by the hand
                     of his own son, who was the king's wine-pourer, he administered poison to the

                     dare write about the drug. Casander, however, is plainly disclosed by his own
                     actions as a bitter enemy to Alexander's policies. He murdered Olympias and
                     threw out her body without burial, and with great enthusiasm restored Thebes,

                     the rivers and most conspicuous for its prosperity. Here were the dominions of

                     sea: Cilicia, Pamphylia, and Coelê Syria, which encloses Phoenicia. Along the
                     frontiers of Coelê Syria and along the desert that lies next to it, through
                     which the Nile makes its way and divides Syria and Egypt, the best satrapy of

                     not been the cause of your exile, but, save for those of you who are under a
                     curse, we shall be the cause of your return to your own native cities. We have
                     written to Antipater about this to the end that if any cities are not willing
                     to restore you, he may constrain them."</p>

                  <p>When the herald had announced this, the crowd showed its approval with loud
                     applause; for those at the festival welcomed the favour of the king with cries
                     of joy, and repaid his good deed with praises. All the exiles had come together
                     at the festival, being more than twenty thousand in number. </p>

                  <p>Now people in general welcomed the restoration of the exiles as a good thing,
                     but the Aetolians had exiled the Oeniadae from their native city and expected
                     the punishment appropriate to their wrongdoing; for the king himself had
                     threatened that no sons of the Oeniadae, but he himself, would punish them.</p>

                     however, for the forces of the king, they remained quiet for the time being,
                     waiting for a favourable opportunity, which Fortune quickly gave them. </p>

                     leadership of the Greeks. As a resource for the war they had the sum of money
                     left by Harpalus, the story of which we told in full in the preceding Book, and
                     likewise the mercenaries who, some eight thousand in number, had been dismissed
                     from service by the satraps and were waiting near Taenarum in the

                     without authority from the city, in order that Antipater, regarding Leosthenes
                     with contempt, might be less energetic in his preparations, and the Athenians,
                     on the other hand, might gain leisure and time for preparing some of the things

                     contrary to general belief, had secured a considerable number of men ready for
                     action; for these men, who had campaigned throughout Asia for a long time and

                     the king's death, then the popular government openly disclosed its intention of
                     war and sent Leosthenes part of the money of Harpalus and many suits of armour,
                     bidding him no longer act in secret but do openly whatever was
                     advantageous.</p>

                  <p> After Leosthenes had distributed their pay to the mercenaries and had fully

                     When the Aetolians listened to him gladly and gave him seven thousand soldiers,
                     he sent to the Locrians and the Phocians and the other neighbouring peoples and
                     urged them to assert their freedom and rid Greece of the Macedonian despotism.

                     venturing to meet forces that were great and undefeated, and moreover, although

                     Athenians for some such reason as the following. After Alexander had razed

                     Athenians, if they were successful in the war, would restore both fatherland

                     took over Egypt without difficulty and was treating the inhabitants with
                     kindness. Finding eight thousand talents in the treasury, he began to collect
                     mercenaries and to form an army. A multitude of friends also gathered about him

                     although he had in all no more than four thousand foot soldiers and only two

                     drew up their lines, placing the cavalry in front of the phalanx of infantry,

                     rushing upon the infantry of the enemy, began to make great slaughter. The
                     Greeks, since they were not able to withstand the weight and number of the
                     enemy, immediately withdrew to the rough ground, carefully keeping their ranks.

                     Then, after such a combat as I have described, the battle was broken off, as
                     the scales of victory swung in favour of the Macedonians. More than five
                     hundred of the Greeks were killed in the battle, and one hundred and thirty of

                     then, when they were in position to fight on equal terms, seek a final
                     decision, or, yielding to the present situation, should send envoys to seek a

                     the Greeks refused to agree to peace terms city by city, Antipater and Craterus
                     began to lay siege to the cities in Thessaly and to take them by storm, since
                     the Greeks could not send aid to them. When the cities were thus badly
                     frightened and each on its own account began to send envoys about a settlement,

                     friends, treacherously murdered him and gained control of the money and the

                     was using them as instructors in his project because of their knowledge of the
                     locality. When the Cyrenians opposed him and a battle took place, Thibron was
                     victorious, killing many and taking captive no small number.</p>

                  <p>He sent envoys, moreover, to the other cities, asking them to make an alliance

                     also treated as spoil the property of the traders that had been captured in the
                     port and gave it to his soldiers as plunder, calling forth their zeal for the

                  <p>Although the affairs of Thibron were thus prospering, Fortune by a sudden shift
                     humbled him through the following circumstances. One of his leaders, a Cretan
                     by birth, whose name was Mnasicles, a man of experience in warfare, quarrelled
                     with him, having complained about the distribution of the booty; and being
                     contentious by nature and bold, he deserted to the Cyrenians. </p>

               <div
                  n="2">
                  <p>Moreover, he made many complaints against Thibron, charging him with cruelty
                     and faithlessness, and persuaded the Cyrenians to break the treaty and make a
                     bid for liberty. And so when sixty talents only had been paid, and the rest of
                     the money was not being given, Thibron denounced the rebels, seized any
                     Cyrenians who were in the port, some eighty in number, and then, leading his
                     forces directly against the city, laid siege to it. As he was unable to
                     accomplish anything, he returned to the port.</p>

                  <p>Since the people of Barca and of Hesperis were allied with Thibron, the

                     plundered the land of their neighbours.</p>

                     persuaded those who were left in Cyrenê to attack it.</p>

                  <p> When they obeyed him, he at once made an attack on the port, leading the way
                     himself; and, easily gaining control of it thanks to the absence of Thibron, he
                     restored to the merchants what was left of the cargoes and zealously guarded
                     the port. </p>

                  <p>At first Thibron was disheartened, since he had lost an advantageous position

                     spirits and captured by siege the city called Tauchira, his hopes again rose.
                     It chanced, however, that in a short time he again encountered great
                     misfortunes.</p>

                     short of food, were accustomed each day to go out into the country and gather
                     supplies there; but the Libyans ambushed them as they were wandering about the
                     country, killed many, and took no small number captive. Those who escaped the
                     danger fled to the ships and sailed away for the allied cities. But when a
                     great storm overtook them, most of the ships were swallowed by the sea; of the
                     rest, some were cast ashore in Cyprus, others in Egypt. </p>

                  <p> Nevertheless Thibron, although he had encountered such a misfortune, did not
                     give up the campaign. Selecting those of his friends who were fitted for the
                     task, he sent them to the Peloponnesus to hire those of the mercenaries who
                     were waiting about near Taenarum; for many of the discharged mercenaries were
                     still roaming about seeking paymasters; and at that time there were more than
                     twenty-five hundred of them at Taenarum.</p>

                     defeated Thibron, killing many of his soldiers.</p>

                     operations against Cyrenê, he unexpectedly regained courage; for as soon as the
                     soldiers from Taenarum put into port and a large force was added to his
                     strength, he became confident in spirit.</p>

                     collected in all thirty thousand men including their citizen soldiers, they
                     made ready to reach a final decision in battle. When a great battle had taken
                     place, Thibron, having won the victory with great slaughter of the enemy, was
                     overjoyed, believing that he would at once capture the adjacent cities;</p>

                     defenders because of the lack of men, the citizens performed a heroic and
                     memorable deed. Seeing that the punishment that hung over them could not be
                     averted, and not having a force that would be adequate to stave the enemy off,
                     they determined not to surrender the city and place their fate in the hands of
                     the enemy, since in that way their punishment combined with outrage was

                     shut up their children, wives, and parents in their houses, and set the houses

                     him gain the supreme power. But not wishing as yet to reveal his design, he
                     married Nicaea for the time, so that he might not render Antipater hostile to
                     his own undertakings. Presently, however, Antigonus learned his intentions, and
                     since Antigonus was a friend of Antipater and, moreover, the most energetic of
                     the commanders, Perdiccas decided to put him out of the way.</p>

                  <p>So, by bringing false slanders and unjust charges against him, he clearly
                     revealed his intention of destroying him. Antigonus, however, who excelled in
                     keenness and daring, outwardly let it be known that he wished to defend himself
                     against these charges, but secretly he made arrangements for flight and, with
                     his personal friends and his son Demetrius, boarded the Athenian ships
                     unexpectedly at night. And having been brought to Europe in these, he travelled
                     on to join forces with Antipater. </p>

                     manhood to the number of ten thousand, they retired to the mountainous and
                     rough places, in which they placed the children, the women, and the old,
                     together with the greater part of their wealth. The cities that could not be
                     defended they abandoned, but those that were particularly strong they secured,
                     each with a considerable garrison, and boldly awaited the approach of the

                     were easy to capture were deserted, moved against the men who had withdrawn
                     into the difficult regions. At first, then, the Macedonians, violently
                     attacking positions that were strongly fortified and in broken terrain, lost
                     many of their soldiers; for the hardihood of the Aetolians joined with the
                     strength of their positions easily turned back men who rushed headlong into
                     dangers beyond reach of succour. Afterward, however, when Craterus had built
                     shelters and was forcing the enemy to stay through the winter and to hold out
                     in regions that were covered with snow and lacking in food, the Aetolians were

                     utterly destroyed by want and cold. When they were already giving up hope of
                     salvation, relief from their troubles appeared of its own accord, just as if
                     one of the gods had been moved to pity by their high courage.</p>

                     come at once with his army to Macedonia as king and deprive Antipater of the

                  <p>Craterus and Antipater, dumbfounded by the unexpected news, met in council with

                     was unanimously decided to make peace with the Aetolians on whatever terms were
                     possible, to transport the armies with all speed to Asia, to assign the command
                     of Asia to Craterus and that of Europe to Antipater, and also to send an
                     embassy to Ptolemy to discuss concerted action, since he was utterly hostile to
                     Perdiccas but friendly to them, and he in common with them was an object of the

                  <p> Therefore they at once made a treaty with the Aetolians, firmly resolved to
                     conquer them later and to move them all — men, women, and children — to the
                     most distant desert of Asia. When they had recorded a decree embodying these
                     plans, they made preparations for the campaign. </p>
                  <p> Perdiccas, gathering his friends and generals, referred to them for
                     consideration the question whether it was better to march against Macedonia or
                     first to take the field against Ptolemy. When all favoured defeating Ptolemy
                     first in order that there might be no obstacle in the way of their Macedonian
                     campaign, he sent Eumenes off with a considerable army, ordering him to watch
                     over the region of the Hellespont and prevent a crossing; and he himself,
                     taking the army from Pisidia, proceeded against Egypt. </p>

                     of bringing home the body of Alexander, having completed the vehicle on which
                     the royal body was to be carried, was making preparations for the journey.</p>

                  <p>Since the structure that had been made ready, being worthy of the glory of
                     Alexander, not only surpassed all others in cost — it had been constructed at
                     the expense of many talents — but was also famous for the excellence of its
                     workmanship, I believe that it is well to describe it. </p>
                  <p> First they prepared a coffin of the proper size for the body, made of hammered
                     gold, and the space about the body they filled with spices such as could make
                     the body sweet smelling and incorruptible.</p>

                  <p>Upon this chest there had been placed a cover of gold, matching it to a nicety,
                     and fitting about its upper rim. Over this was laid a magnificent purple robe
                     embroidered with gold, beside which they placed the arms of the deceased,
                     wishing the design of the whole to be in harmony with his accomplishments.</p>

                  <p>Then they set up next to it the covered carriage that was to carry it. At the
                     top of the carriage was built a vault of gold, eight cubits wide and twelve
                     long, covered with overlapping scales set with precious stones. Beneath the
                     roof all along the work was a rectangular cornice of gold, from which projected
                     heads of goat-stags in high relief. Gold rings two palms broad were suspended
                     from these, and through the rings there ran a festive garland beautifully
                     decorated in bright colours of all kinds.</p>

                     who were approaching heard the sound from a great distance. On each corner of
                     the vault on each side was a golden figure of Victory holding a trophy. The
                     colonnade that supported the vault was of gold with Ionic capitals. Within the
                     colonnade was a golden net, made of cords the thickness of a finger, which
                     carried four long painted tablets, their ends adjoining, each equal in length
                     to a side of the colonnade. </p>

                  <p> On the first of these tablets was a chariot ornamented with work in relief,
                     and sitting in it was Alexander holding a very splendid sceptre in his hands.
                     About the king were groups of armed attendants, one of Macedonians, a second of
                     Persians of the bodyguard, and armed soldiers in front of them. The second
                     tablet showed the elephants arrayed for war who followed the bodyguard. They
                     carried Indian mahouts in front with Macedonians fully armed in their regular
                     equipment behind them. The third tablet showed troops of cavalry as if in
                     formation for battle; and the fourth, ships made ready for naval combat. Beside
                     the entrance to the chamber there were golden lions with eyes turned toward
                     those who would enter.</p>

                     under the open sky there was a purple banner blazoned with a golden olive
                     wreath of great size, and when the sun cast upon it its rays, it sent forth
                     such a bright and vibrant gleam that from a great distance it appeared like a

                     turned four Persian wheels, the naves and spokes of which were gilded, but the
                     part that bore upon the ground was of iron. The projecting parts of the axle
                     were made of gold in the form of lion heads, each holding a spear in its teeth.

                     selected for their strength and size. Each of them was crowned with a gilded
                     crown, each had a golden bell hanging by either cheek, and about their necks

                     drew together many spectators; for from every city into which it came the whole
                     people went forth to meet it and again escorted it on its way out, not becoming

                     Arrhidaeus had spent nearly two years in making ready this work, he brought the

                     consideration. He decided for the present not to send it to Ammon, but to
                     entomb it in the city that had been founded by Alexander himself, which lacked

                  <p>But Neoptolemus, who had saved himself from the battle with three hundred
                     horsemen, rode off with them to Antipater. A council of war was held, and it
                     was decided to divide the forces into two parts. Antipater was to take one part
                     and set out for Cilicia to fight against Perdiccas, and Craterus with the other
                     part was to attack Eumenes and, after defeating him, to join Antipater. In this
                     way, when they had combined their forces and had added Ptolemy to the alliance,
                     they might be able to overmatch the royal armies. </p>

                     the Macedonian phalanx with his foot soldiers, he made ready a noteworthy corps

                     and he fell to the ground, where he was trampled under foot and ended his life

                     the duel between themselves. After the opening exchange of sword strokes they
                     engaged in a strange and most extraordinary duel; for, carried away by their
                     anger and their mutual hatred, they let the reins fall from their left hands
                     and grappled each other. As a result of this, their horses were carried out
                     from under them by their own momentum, and the men themselves fell to the

                     the rout of the other wing, all made off and fled for refuge to the phalanx of
                     their infantry as to a strong fortress. Eumenes, satisfied with his advantage

                     strength and collected supplies, they set out at night and went off secretly to

                     those who were retreating and to the weakness caused by his wounds, he was
                     unable to accomplish anything and gave up the pursuit. So by winning a notable

                     Perdiccas, on learning of the victory of Eumenes, became much more confident in
                     regard to the Egyptian campaign; and when he approached the Nile, he camped not

                     the contrary, was generous and fair and granted to all the commanders the right
                     to speak frankly. What is more, he had secured all the most important points in

                     friendly intercourse with all, won them over to his service and inspired them
                     to meet the coming dangers. After warning them to be ready to break camp, he
                     set out with his army at evening, disclosing to no one the point to which he

                     dawning, he began to send the army across, the elephants in the van, then
                     following them the shield-bearers and the ladder-carriers, and others whom he
                     expected to use in the attack on the fort. Last of all came the bravest of the

                     threw themselves into the fort, and made their arrival known by blasts of the
                     trumpet and by shouts, the troops of Perdiccas were not frightened, but boldly

                     himself and wished to encourage the other commanders and friends to face the
                     dangers, taking his long spear and posting himself on the top of the outwork,

                     and wounded its Indian mahout. Then, with utter contempt of the danger,

                     been opened and, joining with the river, had made the ford deeper; others said
                     that rain falling in the regions above had increased the volume of the

                     crossing of the ford had been freer from danger because the sand at the
                     crossing had been undisturbed, but in the course of the other crossings by the

                     Ptolemy, however, burned the bodies of those who were cast up on his side of

                     the top of a lofty crag, and it had been marvellously fortified, partly by
                     nature, partly by the work of men's hands.</p>

                     supply for many years all the needs of those who took refuge there. Eumenes was
                     accompanied in his flight by those of his friends who were exceptionally loyal
                     and had determined to die along with him if it came to the worst straits. In
                     all, counting both cavalry and infantry, there were about six hundred souls.

                     was no longer any commander in all Asia who had an army strong enough to

                     Eumenes, renewed the former friendship, and tried to persuade him to cast his
                     lot with him. Eumenes, however, being well aware that Fortune changes quickly,

                     referred these matters to Antipater, and then, after placing a sufficient guard
                     about the fortress, he set out to meet those commanders of the enemy who
                     survived and had troops, namely Alcetas, who was brother of Perdiccas, and

                     his own interests. He hoped, therefore, as truly happened, that many would have
                     need of him because of his judgement and his experience in warfare, and even

                     however, they changed their minds and refrained from burning the city, but they
                     devoted themselves to brigandage and guerrilla warfare, ravaging much of the

                  <p>As for Antigonus, he took the body of Alcetas and maltreated it for three days;
                     then, as the corpse began to decay, he threw it out unburied and departed from
                     Pisidia. But the young men of Termessus, still preserving their goodwill for
                     the victim, recovered the body and honoured it with splendid obsequies. Thus
                     kindness in its very nature possesses the peculiar power of a love charm in

                     him with the news that Antipater had died, and that the supreme command and the
                     guardianship of the kings had fallen to Polyperchon the Macedonian.</p>

                     illness, which old age was tending to make fatal, the Athenians sent Demades as
                     envoy to Antipater, a man who had the reputation of serving the city well in

                     the garrison from Munychia. Antipater at first had been well disposed to
                     Demades, but after the death of Perdiccas certain letters were found in the
                     royal archives in which Demades invited Perdiccas to cross over swiftly into
                     Europe against Antipater. At this Antipater was alienated from him and kept his

                     who had campaigned with Alexander and was held in honour by the Macedonians.

                     the Persian kings, and afterwards under Alexander it gained great power and
                     glory at the time when he became an admirer of this and all other Persian
                     customs. For this reason Antipater, following the same course, appointed his

                     first stirring of revolution, since each of those in power undertook to work
                     for his own ends. Antigonus, who was foremost of these, had already won a
                     victory over Eumenes in Cappadocia and had taken over his army, and he had also
                     completely defeated Alcetas and Attalus in Pisidia and had annexed their
                     troops. Moreover, he had been chosen supreme commander of Asia by Antipater,
                     and at the same time he had been appointed general of a great army, for which
                     reasons he was filled with pride and haughtiness.</p>

                     forces also if there should be need, since Asia could provide pay without end

                     fellow citizen of Eumenes of Cardia, who had taken refuge in the stronghold
                     called Nora. After endeavouring to attach Hieronymus to himself by great gifts,
                     he sent him as an envoy to Eumenes, urging the latter to forget the battle that
                     had been fought against him in Cappadocia, to become his friend and ally, to
                     receive gifts many times the value of what he had formerly possessed and a
                     greater satrapy, and in general to be the first of Antigonus' friends and his

                     to some of the more important friends and military commands to others; and by
                     holding up great expectations to all of them, he filled them with enthusiasm
                     for his undertakings. Indeed he had in mind to go through Asia, remove the

                     Hellespontine Phrygia, discovering his plan, decided to provide for the safety
                     of his own satrapy and also to secure the most considerable cities by means of
                     garrisons. As the city of the Cyziceni was strategically most important and
                     very large, he set out against it with an infantry force consisting of more
                     than ten thousand mercenaries, a thousand Macedonians, and five hundred Persian
                     bowmen and slingers. He had also eight hundred horsemen, all kinds of missiles,
                     catapults both for bolts and for stones, and all the other equipment proper for
                     storming a city.</p>

                     who were in the city, tried to force them to receive a garrison. Since the
                     attack had been unexpected, most of the Cyziceni had been cut off in the
                     country; and with only a few people left in the city, they were completely
                     unprepared for the siege.</p>

                     confer with Arrhidaeus about raising the siege, saying that the city would do
                     anything for him except receive a garrison; but secretly, after assembling the
                     young men and selecting the slaves who were suitable for the purpose, they
                     armed them and manned the wall with defenders.</p>

                     success; for since the Cyziceni possessed a city that was strong and very easy
                     to defend from attacks by land thanks to its being a peninsula, and since they
                     controlled the sea, they easily warded off the enemy.</p>

                     else was of use for withstanding the attack. When the people of Byzantium
                     supplied all this quickly and willingly, the Cyziceni became confident and set
                     themselves courageously against the danger.</p>

                     of soldiers, and after killing many of the besieging force, they rid themselves
                     of the siege. Thus Arrhidaeus, outgeneralled by the Cyziceni, returned to his

                     satrapy into a private domain. Finally, he ordered him to retire from his

                     the cities with garrisons he was making the first move in his war to a finish
                     with Antigonus. In accordance with this decision, after making the cities
                     secure, he sent away a part of his army and a general in command of it. He
                     ordered the latter to get in touch with Eumenes, relieve the fortress from

                  <p>Antigonus took Ephesus at the first assault with the aid of certain
                     confederates within the city. After this, when Aeschylus of Rhodes sailed to
                     Ephesus conveying from Cilicia in four ships six hundred talents of silver that
                     were being sent to Macedonia for the kings, Antigonus laid hands on it, saying
                     that he needed it to pay his mercenaries.</p>

                     cities in order, taking some of them by force and winning others by persuasion.

                     narrative to the fortunes of Eumenes. This man experienced great and incredible
                     reversals of fortune, continually having a share in good and evil beyond

                  <p>For example, in the period preceding these events, when he was fighting for
                     Perdiccas and the kings, he had received as his satrapy Cappadocia and the
                     adjacent regions, in which as master of great armies and much wealth his good
                     fortune became famous.</p>

                     field.</p>

                  <p>But although he won the reputation of being irresistible, he experienced such a
                     change of fortune that he was defeated by Antigonus in a great battle and
                     compelled to take refuge with a few friends in a certain very small fortress.
                     Shut up there and surrounded by the enemy with a double wall, he had no one to
                     give him aid in his own misfortune.</p>

                  <p>When the siege had lasted a year and hope of safety had been abandoned, there
                     suddenly appeared an unexpected deliverance from his plight; for Antigonus, who
                     was besieging him and bent on destroying him, changed his plan, invited him to
                     share in his own undertakings, and after receiving an oath-bound pledge, freed
                     him from the siege.</p>

                  <p>Thus unexpectedly saved after a considerable time, he stayed for the present in
                     Cappadocia, where he gathered together his former friends and those who had
                     once served under him and were now wandering about the country. Since he was
                     highly esteemed, he quickly found many men to share in his expectations and to
                     enlist for the campaign with him.</p>

                     been besieged in the fortress with him, he had more than two thousand soldiers
                     who followed him of their own free will. With the aid of Fortune he gained so
                     great an increase in power that he took over the royal armies and championed
                     the kings against those who had boldly tried to end their rule. But we shall

                     attention to what had taken place at the same time in Europe. Although
                     Cassander had failed to gain the ruling position in Macedonia, he was not
                     dismayed; but he determined to maintain his claim to it, holding it disgraceful
                     that his father's office should be administered by others.</p>

                  <p>Since he perceived that the favour of the Macedonians inclined to Polyperchon,
                     he had further private conversations with the friends in whom he most trusted
                     and sent them to the Hellespont without arousing suspicion; and he himself, by
                     spending several days at leisure in the country and organizing a hunt, created
                     the general opinion that he would not try to gain the office.</p>

                  <p>When everything necessary for his departure was ready, however, he set out from
                     Macedonia unobserved. He came to the Chersonese and departing thence arrived at
                     the Hellespont. Sailing across into Asia to Antigonus he begged him to aid him,
                     saying that Ptolemy also had promised to be an ally. Antigonus eagerly received
                     him and promised to co‑operate with him actively in every way and to give him
                     at once a force of infantry and a fleet.</p>

                  <p>In doing this he pretended to be aiding him because of his own friendship for
                     Antipater, but in truth it was because he wished Polyperchon to be surrounded
                     by many great distractions, so that he himself might proceed against Asia
                     without danger and secure the supreme power for himself. </p>

                  <p> Meanwhile in Macedonia, Polyperchon, the guardian of the kings, after
                     Cassander had slipped away, foresaw the serious character of the war that was
                     to be fought with him, and since he had made up his mind to do nothing without
                     the advice of his friends, he called together all the commanders and the most
                     important of the other Macedonians.</p>

               <div

                  <p>It was clear that Cassander, reinforced by Antigonus, would hold the Greek
                     cities against them, since some of the cities were guarded by his father's
                     garrisons and others, dominated by Antipater's friends and mercenaries, were
                     ruled by oligarchies, and since Cassander would also gain as allies both
                     Ptolemy the ruler of Egypt, and Antigonus, who had already openly rebelled
                     against the kings, and each of them possessed great armies and abundant wealth
                     and was master of many nations and cities of consequence. After the question
                     how to fight against these had been laid before them and many shrewd
                     suggestions had been made about the war, it was decided to free the cities
                     throughout Greece and to overthrow the oligarchies established in them by
                     Antipater;</p>

               <div

                  <p>for in this way they would best decrease the influence of Cassander and also
                     win for themselves great glory and many considerable allies.</p>

               <div
                  n="4">
                  <p>At once, therefore, they called together the envoys who were present from the
                     cities, and after bidding them be of good cheer, they promised to re‑establish
                     democratic governments in the cities. As soon as they had drafted the decree
                     that had been adopted, they gave it to the envoys, in order that they might
                     quickly return to their native cities and report to their assemblies the
                     goodwill that the kings and the generals entertained for the Greeks. The edict
                     was in such terms as these: </p>

                     generals, and many bitter things befell the cities, know ye that the generals
                     have been responsible for these hardships, but that we, holding fast to the

                     already clearly shown that he was a rebel against the kings. He said that the
                     kings were restoring to him the satrapy that Antigonus had taken away and all

                     guardians of the kings, but were in truth trying to transfer the kingdom to

                     present until the war should come to some decision. As for himself, since he
                     had always observed the most unwavering loyalty toward the kings, he decided
                     not to take orders from Antigonus, who was trying to appropriate the kingship
                     for himself; but since the son of Alexander was in need of help because of his
                     orphaned state and the greediness of the commanders, he believed that it was
                     incumbent upon himself to run every risk for the safety of the kings. </p>

                     Cappadocia with about five hundred horsemen and more than two thousand foot
                     soldiers. Indeed, he did not have time to wait for the laggards among those who
                     had promised to join him, for a considerable army was drawing near, sent from
                     Antigonus under the general Menander to prevent Eumenes from staying in

                  <p>Eumenes himself quickly passed over the Taurus by forced marches and entered
                     Cilicia. Antigenes and Teutamus, the leaders of the Silver Shields, in
                     obedience to the letters of the kings, came from a considerable distance to
                     meet Eumenes and his friends. After bidding him welcome and congratulating him
                     on his unexpected escape from very great dangers, they promised to co‑operate
                     willingly with him in everything. The Macedonian Silver Shields, about three
                     thousand in number, likewise met him with friendship and zeal.</p>

                  <p>All wondered at the incredible fickleness of Fortune, when they considered that
                     a little while before the kings and the Macedonians had condemned Eumenes and
                     his friends to death, but now, forgetting their own decision, they not only had
                     let him off scot-free of punishment, but also had entrusted to him the supreme
                     command over the entire kingdom.</p>

                  <p>And it was with good reason that these emotions were shared by all who then
                     beheld the reversals in Eumenes' fortunes; for who, taking thought of the
                     inconstancies of human life, would not be astonished at the alternating ebb and
                     flow of fortune? Or who, putting his trust in the predominance he enjoys when
                     Fortune favours him, would adopt a bearing too high for mortal weakness?</p>

                     and evil alternately for all time. It is not strange, then, that some one
                     unforeseen event has taken place, but rather that all that happens is not
                     unexpected. This is also a good reason for admitting the claim of history, for
                     in the inconstancy and irregularity of events history furnishes a corrective
                     for both the arrogance of the fortunate and the despair of the destitute. </p>

                     perceived that he himself was a foreigner and had no claim to the royal power,
                     that the Macedonians who were now subject to him had previously decreed his
                     death, and that those who occupied the military commands were filled with
                     arrogance and were aiming at great affairs. He therefore understood that he
                     would soon be despised and at the same time envied, and that his life would
                     eventually be in danger; for no one will willingly carry out orders given by
                     those whom he regards as his inferiors, or be patient when he has over him as

                     great task. In any case, owing to his continuous military service, he was no
                     longer able to endure the skirmishes and journeyings, especially since no
                     magistracy was in prospect for one who was an alien and hence was excluded from

                     commanders, and actively administering all the affairs of the monarchy.</p>

                     of the insignia have been placed on it, all the commanders must at daybreak

                     presence, and receive their orders in the name of the king just as if he were

                     the royal treasure was rich in gold. Straightway then, when a magnificent tent
                     had been set up, the throne was erected, upon which were placed the diadem, the
                     sceptre, and the armour that Alexander had been wont to use. Then when an altar
                     with a fire upon it had been put in place, all the commanders would make
                     sacrifice from a golden casket, presenting frankincense and the most costly of
                     the other kinds of incense and making obeisance to Alexander as to a god.</p>

                     from time to time required their attention. Eumenes, by placing himself on an
                     equality with the other commanders in all the matters that were discussed and
                     by seeking their favour through the most friendly intercourse, wore down the
                     envy with which he had been regarded and secured for himself a great deal of

                     toward the Macedonian Silver Shields in a similar way, Eumenes gained great

                     them went at once into Pisidia, Lycia, and the adjacent regions, where they
                     zealously enrolled troops. Others travelled through Cilicia, others through

                  <p>Since the news of this levy spread widely and the pay offered was worthy of

                     Greece and were enrolled for the campaign. In a short time more than ten

                     Shields and to the other Macedonians with Eumenes. With him he also sent thirty
                     other Macedonians, meddlesome and talkative persons, whom he instructed to meet
                     separately with Antigenes and Teutamus, the commanders of the Silver Shields,
                     and through them to organize some plot against Eumenes by promising great gifts
                     and greater satrapies. Antigonus also told them to get in touch with their
                     acquaintances and fellow citizens among the Silver Shields and secure their
                     support for the plot against Eumenes by corrupting them with bribes.</p>

                     he showed him that it was to his advantage that Eumenes rather than Antigonus

                     a foreigner, would never dare to advance his own interests, but, remaining a
                     general, would treat them as friends and, if they co‑operated with him, would

                     in accordance with the edict that had been issued concerning the autonomy of
                     the Greeks; and they themselves, holding frequent meetings of the Assembly,

                     was frightened and promised to make the restoration, but he avoided the
                     fulfilment of the promise by constantly making excuses. The Athenians, who had

                  <p> When the Megalopolitans learned the intention of Polyperchon, they voted to
                     bring all their property into the city from the country. On taking a census of
                     citizens, foreigners, and slaves, they found that there were fifteen thousand
                     men capable of performing military service. Some of these they at once attached
                     to military formations, others they assigned to work gangs, and others they
                     detailed to take care of the city wall.</p>

                     city, and another was bringing from the country timber for a palisade; some
                     were repairing the weakened portions of the wall, while others were engaged in
                     making weapons and in preparing engines for hurling bolts, and the whole city
                     was deep in activity, owing both to the spirit of the population and to the

                     the multitude of the accompanying elephants, which were reputed to possess a
                     fighting spirit and a momentum of body that were irresistible. </p>

                  <p>When all had been hastily made ready, Polyperchon arrived with his entire army
                     and took up his position near the city, building two camps, one for the
                     Macedonians, the other for the allies. Having constructed wooden towers higher
                     than the walls, he brought them up to the city in those places that were
                     convenient for the purpose, supplied them with missiles of many kinds and men
                     to hurl these, and drove back those who were arrayed against him on the
                     battlements.</p>

                  <p>Meantime his sappers drove mines under the wall and then, by burning the mine
                     props, caused the ruin of three very large towers and as many intervening
                     sections of the wall. At this great and unexpected collapse the crowd of
                     Macedonians shouted with joy, but those in the city were stunned by the
                     seriousness of the event.</p>

                  <p>Immediately the Macedonians began to pour through the breach into the city,
                     while the Megalopolitans divided themselves, some of them opposing the enemy
                     and, aided by the difficulty of the passage through the breach, putting up a
                     stout fight, the rest cutting off the area inside the breach with a palisade
                     and throwing up a second wall, applying themselves day and night without

                     the loss they had suffered by the breaching of the wall. Moreover, against
                     those of the enemy who were fighting from the wooden towers they used
                     bolt-shooting catapults, slingers, and bowmen, and mortally wounded many. </p>

                     elephants, whose might he planned to use in capturing the city. The
                     Megalopolitans, however, under the leadership of Damis, who had been in Asia
                     with Alexander and knew by experience the nature and the use of these animals,
                     got the better of him completely.</p>

                     Damis rendered their physical strength useless. He studded many great frames
                     with sharp nails and buried them in shallow trenches, concealing the projecting
                     points; over them he left a way into the city, placing none of the troops
                     directly in the face of it, but posting on the flanks a great many javelin
                     throwers, bowmen, and catapults.</p>

                     making an attack through it with all the elephants in a body, a most unexpected
                     thing befell them. There being no resistance in front, the Indian mahouts did
                     their part in urging them to rush into the city all together; but the animals,
                     as they charged violently, encountered the spike-studded frames. Wounded in
                     their feet by the spikes, their own weight causing the points to penetrate,
                     they could neither go forward any farther nor turn back because it hurt them to

                     so lost such use of the elephants as the situation permitted. The elephants,
                     suffering great pain because of the cloud of missiles and the natures of the
                     wounds caused by the spikes, wheeled about through their friends and trod down
                     many of them. Finally the elephant that was the most valiant and formidable
                     collapsed; of the rest, some became completely useless, and others brought
                     death to many of their own side. </p>

                     events that deserve commemoration in our account. </p>
