### TLDR;

Convert new lines to pipes (`|`), so you can add your passage with syntactic markdown to a new CEX edition.

Example: convert

```
>pueros in profluentem aquam mitti

iubet.
```
to


```
>pueros in profluentem aquam mitti||iubet.
```

Your CEX could look like:

```
urn:cts:omar:stoa0179.stoa001.reducedSyntax:1.4#pueros in profluentem aquam mitti||iubet.
```
